or even of life ¹3⁶. ¹ But as the annual growth of the sons of the
veteratis bore a very small proportion to the demands of the
service, levies of men were frequently required from the provinces,
and every proprietor was obliged either to take up arins, or to procure
a substitute, or to purchase his exemption by the payment of a heavy
fine. The sum of forty-two pieces of gold, to which, it was reduced,
ascertains the exorbitant price of volunteers, and the reluCtance.
with which the government admitted of this alternative ¹37. Such
Was the horror for the profeflion of a soldier, which had affee’ted the
minds of the degenerate Romans, that many of the youth of Italy,
and the provinces, chose to cut off the fingere of their right hand
to escape from being preffed into the service 3 and this strange expe-

dient was so commonly praeiised, as to deserve the severe animad- ’

version of the laws¹³2‚ and a peculi-ar name in the Latin lan-
guage ¹3⁹.

The introduecion of Barbarians into the Roman armies became

every day more universal, more necessary, and more fatal.

De Filiis Veteranorum, in the seventh book
of the Theodofian Code. The age at which
their military service was required, varied
from twenty-five to sixteen. If the sons of
the veterans appeared with a horse, they had
a right to serve in the cavalry; two horses
gave them some valuable privileges.

According to the historian Socrates (see Gode-

times required eighty pieces of gold for :i re-

knight‚ who had mutilated his two sons,
were sold at public auftion by the order of

the spirit of the times. Ammianus makes a
distinffion between the effeminate Italians
and the hardy Gauls. (L. xv. c. ιε.) Yet
only fifteen years afterwards, Valentinian, in
a law addreffed to the praefeft of Gaul,
is obliged to ena& 'that these cowardly de-
serters lhall be burnt alive. (Cod. Theod-
l. vii. tit. xiii. leg, 5.) Their numbers in Il-
lyricum were so considerable, that the pro-
rince complained of a scarcity of recruits.

this particular instance of cowardice, marcam
