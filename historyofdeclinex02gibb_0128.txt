the adjacent country. By the labour of the Pei-flans, the course of
the river was stopped below the town, and the waters were con-
fined on every fide by solid lnounds of earth. On this artificial lake,
a fleet of armed veffels, filled with soldiers, and with engines which
discharged stones of five hundred pounds weight,advanced in order of
battle, and engaged, almost upon a level, the troops which defended
the ramparts. The irresistible force of the waters was alternately
fatal to the contending parties, till at length a portion of the walls,
unable to sustain the accumulated pressure, gave way at once, and
