sand men were baptized at Rome, besides a proportionable number
o'f women and children, and that a white garment, with twenty
pieces of gold, had been promised by the, emperor to every convert³⁵.
The powerful influence of Constantine was ‘not circumscribed by the
marrow limits of his life, or of his dominions. The education which
he bestowed on his sons and nephews, secured to the empire a race of
princes, whose faith was still more lively and smeere, as they im-
bibed, in their earliest infancy, the spirit, or at least the doc'crine, of
Christianity. War and commerce had spread the knowledge
os the gospel beyond the confines of the Roman provinces3 and
the Barbarfflns, who had disdained an humble and proscribed
seer, soon learned to esteem a religion which had been so Iately
embraced by the greatest monarch and the most civilized nation

of the globe⁷‘. The Goths and Germans, who enlisted under
the standard of Rome, revered the cross which glittered at the head

Such evidence is contemptible enough3 but
these circumstances are in themselves so pro—

freedom to all the ssaves who should embrace
Christianity. The emperor did indeed publish
2 law, which restrained the Jews from circnm-
cifing, perhaps from keeping, any Christian
ssaves (See Euseb. inVit. Constant. 1. iv. e. 27.
and Cod. Theod. 1. xvi. tit. ix. with Gode-
froy’s Commentary‚ tom. vi. p. 247.). But
this imperfeft exception related only to the
Jews ς and the great body of ssaves, who were
the property of Christian or Pagan masters,
could not improve their temporal condition by
changing their religion. I am ignorant by
what guides the Abbe Raynal was deceived;
as the total absence ofquotations is the unpar-
donable blemish of his entertaining history.

bable, that the learned Dr. Howell (History
o‘f the W'orld, vol. iii. p. 14.) has not scru-
pled to adopt them.

⁷⁵ The converfion of the Barbariana under
the reign of Constantine is celebrated by the
ecclesiastical historians (see Sozomeu, l. ii.
c. 6. and Theodoret, 1. i. c. 23, 24). But
Rufinus, the Latin transsator of Eusebius,
deserves to be considered as an original au·
thority. His information was curioussy col—
lefted from one of the companions of the
apostle of AEthiopia‚ and from Bacurius, an
Iberian prince, who was count of the domes—
tics. Father Mamachi has given an ample
compilation on the progress of Christiansty,
in the first and second volumes of his great
but imperfe& work.
