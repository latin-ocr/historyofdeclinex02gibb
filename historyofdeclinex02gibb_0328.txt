μον-..ι composed without being publili-red, or was publissied without

being executed. The evidence of facts, and the monuments
which are still extant of brass- and marble, continue to prove the
public exercise of the pagan worship during the whole reign of
the sons of Constantine. In the East, as well as in the West, in
cities, as well as in the country, a great number of temples were
respected, or at least were spared3 and the devout multitude still
enjoyed the luxury of sacrifices, of festivals, and of proceffions, by
the permiffion, or by the connivance, of the civil government. About
four years after the supposed date of his bloody edict, Constantius
vifited the temples of Rome3 and the decency of his behaviour is
recommended by a pagan orator as an example worthy of the imi-
tation os succeeding princes. “ That emperor,” says Symmachus,
“ suffered the privileges of the vestal virgins to remain inviolate3
“ he bestowed the sacerdotal dignities on the nobles of Rome, granted
“ the customary allowance to defray the expences of the public
“ rites and sacrifices: and, though he had embraced a different re-
“ ligion‚ he never attempted to deprive the empire of the sacred

“ worship of antiquity¹⁶⁵.’' The senate still presumed to conse-
crate, by solemn decrees, the divine memory of their sovereigns;

and Constantine himself was associated, after his death, to those gods
whom he had renounced and insulted during his life. The title, the
eufigns, the prerogatives of SOVEREIGN PONTIFF, which had been
instituted by Numa, and assumed by Augustus, were accepted, with-
out hesitation, by seven Christian emperors 3 who were invested with
a more absolute authority over the religion which they had deserted,
than over that which they profeffed ¹⁶⁷.
