their resistance in the opinion of mankind: but he was not disposed
to sacrifice any solid advantages for the empty praise of justice and
moderatiori. Senfible of the benefits which would result from the

union of the Gothic powers under the same standard, he secretly

Lower Maefia, about seventy miles from the banks of the Danube. On
that fatal spot, the flames of> discord and mutual hatred burst forth
into a dreadful conflagration. Lupicinus had invited the Gothic
chiefs to a splendid entertainment3 and their martial train remained
under arms at the entrance of the palace. But the gates of the city
were strictly guarded ; and the Barbarians were sternly excluded from
