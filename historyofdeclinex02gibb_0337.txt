OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

As soon as the approach of the troops was announced, the
Caesar went out to meet them, and ascended his tribunal, which
had been erected in a plain before the gates of the city. After
distinguissiing the officere and soldiers, who by their rank or
merit delerved a peculiar attention, Julian addrefl'ed himself in a
studied oration ,to the surrounding multitude: he celebrated their
exploits with grateful applause3 encouraged them to accept, with·
alacrity, the honour of serving under the eyes of a powerful and
liberal monarch; and admonished thern, that the commands of Au*
gustus required an instant and cheerful obedience. The soldiers‚
who were apprehensive of offending their general by an indecent
clamour, or of belying their sentiments by false and vena] acclama-
tions, maintained an obstinate filence ; and, after a {hort pause, were
dismissed to their quartem, The principal Officers were entertained
by the Caesar, who profelled, in the warmest language of friendlhip,
his desire andhis inability to reward, according to their defens, the
brave companions of his vicocories.. They retired from the feast, full
of grief and perplexity ;' and lamented, the hardship of their fate,
which tore them from tlieir beloved general and their native country.
The only expedient which could prevent their separation was boldly
agitated and approved; the popular resentmcnt was insenfibly
moulded into a regular conspiracy3 their just reasons of complaint
were heightened by paffion, and their paffions vvere inflamed by

wine3 as on the eve of their departure, the troops were indulged in
licentious festivity. At the hour of midnight, the impetuous multi-
tude, with swords, and bowls, and torches, in their hands, ,russied into
