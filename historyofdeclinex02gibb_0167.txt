OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

:ind elevated, by the efforts of art and laboris, in the great Circus of
Rome ⁴⁶.

The departure of Constantius from Rome was hastened by the
alal-ming intelligence of the distress and danger of the Illyriai] pro-
vinces. The distraffions of civil war, and the irreparable loss which
the Roman legions had sustained in the battle of Mursa, exposed
those countries, almost without defence, to the light cavalry of the
Barffirianffi and particularly to the imoads of the Qadi‚ a fierce
and powerful tuition, who seem to have exchanged the institutions
of Germany for the arms and military arts of their Sarmatian allies ⁴⁷.
The garrisons of the frontier were insufficient to check their pro-
gress ; and the indolent monarch was at length compelled to affemble,
from the extremities of his dominions, the flower of the Palatine
troops, to take the field in person, and to employ a whole campaign„
with the preceding autumn and the ensuing spring, in the serious pro—
secution of the war. The emperor paffed the Danube on a bridgc
of bocas, cut in pieces all that encountered his march, penetrated
,into the heart of the country of the Qadi, and severely retaliated
*the calamities which they had inflicted on the Roman province. The
dismayed Barbarians were soon reduced to sue for peace ε they offered
the restitution of his captive subjeets, as an atonement for the past,
and the noblest hostages as a pledge of their future conduct. The
c generous courtesy which was lhewn to the first among their chief-
tains who implored the clemency of Constantius, encouraged the
more timid, or the more obstinate, to imitate their example3 and
the Imperial camp was crowded with the princes and amball'adors of
the most distant tribes, who occupied the plains of the Less'er Poland³
