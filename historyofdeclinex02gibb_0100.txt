Crispus, the eldest son of Constantine, and the presumptive heir
of the empne, is represented by impartial historians as an amiable

and accomplissied youth. The care of his educati0n‚ or at least of
his studies, was entrusted to Lactantius, the most eloquent of the

stration of the Gallie provinces, where the inroads of the Germans
gave him an early occasion of fignalizing his military prowess.
In the civil war which broke out soon afterwards, the father and-son
divided their powers3 and this history has already celebrated the
valour as well as conduct displayed by the latter, in forcing the
streights of the Hellespont‚ so obstinately defended by the superior
ficet of Licinius. This naval victory contributed to determine the
event of the war3 and the names of Constantine and of Crispus

monarch is acknowledged by his subjeets with reludance, and fre-
