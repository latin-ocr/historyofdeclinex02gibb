THE DECLINE AND FALL.

by an equa] number of ssat—bottomed boats, Which might occalionally
be connected into the form of temporary bridges. The rest of the
ships, partly construit& of timber, and partly covered with raw
hides, were laden with an almost inexhaustible supply of arms and
engines, of utensils and provisions. The vigilant humanity of Ju-
lian had embarked a very large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for ¹
the use os the soIdiers, but he prohibited the indulgence of wine;
and rigoroussy stopped a long string of superfluous camels that at-
tempted to follow the rear of the army. The river Chaboras falls
into the Euphrates at Circesium ⁴²3 and as soon as the trumpet
gave the signal of march, the Romans passed the little stream which
separated two mighty and hostile empires. The custom of ancient
discipline required a military orati0n3 and Julian embraced every
opportunity of displaying his eloquence. He animated the impatient
and attentive legions by the example of the infiexible courage and
glorious triumphs of their ancestors. He exeited their resentment by
a lively pi&ure of the insolence of the Persians3 and he exhorted
them to imitate his firm resolution, either to extirpate that perfi-
dious nation, or to devote his life in the cause of the republic. The
eloquence of Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred
and thirty picces of filver to every soldier3 and the bridge of the
Chaboras was instantly cut away, to convince the troops that they
must place their hopes of safety in the success of their arms. Yet
the prudence of the emperor induced him to secure a remote frontier,
perpetually exposed to the inroads of the hostile Arabs. A detachment
of four thousand men was left at Circesium, which eompleted‚ to the
number of ten thousand, the regular garrison of that important
fortress ⁴²³.
