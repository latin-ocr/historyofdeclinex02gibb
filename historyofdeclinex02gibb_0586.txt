THE DECLINE AND FALL

the horrid objecrs which are disguised by, the arts of European req

ῑ--ν--Ι finement‚ are exhibited in their naked and most disgusting fimpli-

city, in the tent of a Tartarian ssiepherd. The ox, or the sheep, are
ssaughtered by the sai-21< hand from which they were accustomed to
receive their daily food3 and the bleeding limbs are served, with
very little preparation, on the table of⁴ their unfeeling murderer.
In the military profession, and especially in the conduct of a nu-
merous army, the exclusive use of animal food appears to be pro-
duffive of the most solid advantages. Corn is a bulky and perifhable
commodity3 and the large magazines, which are indispensably neces-
sary for the subsrstence of our troops, must be ssowly transported by
the labour of men, or horses. But the fiocks and herds, which
accompany the march of the Tartars, afford a sure and encreafing
supply of flesh and milk : in the far greater part of the uncultivated
waste, the vegetation of the grass is quid< and luxuriant ; and there
are few places so extremely barren, that the hardy cattle of the
North cannot find some tolerable pasture. The supply is mul-
tiplied and prolonged, by the undistinguissiing appetite, and pa-
tient abstinence, of the Tartars. They indifferently feed on the
ficsh of those animals that have been killed for the table, or have
died of disease. Horse-flesh, which in every age and country has,
been proscribed by the ciuvilised nations of Europe and Asia, they
devour with peculiar greediness; and this singular taste facilitates
the success of their military oper-anons. The active cavalry of
Scythia is always followed, in their most distant and rapid incur-
sions, by an adequate number of spare horses‚ who may be occa—
sionally used, either to„ redouble the speed, or to satisfy the hunger,
of the Barbarians. Many are the resources of courage and poverty.
Vffhen the forage round a camp of Tartars is almost confirmed, they
ssaugliter the greatest part of their cattle, and preserve the flesh,

either smoked, or dried in the sun. On the sudden emergency of
