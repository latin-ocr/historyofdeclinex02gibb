THE DECLINE AND FALL

CHAP.

⁴xxm. Of his poverty, they defifed only to bend his inflexible spiritv to the

promise of the ssightest compensation. They apprehended the aged
prelate, they inhumanly scourged him, they tore his beard 3 and his
naked body, anointed with honey, was suspended, in a net, between
heaven and earth, and exposed to the stings of inseds and the rays
F10m this lofty station, Mark still perfisted to

glory 111 his 6111116, and to 11111111 1116 impotent rage of his persecutors

of a Syrian sun⁹⁹

He was at length rescued from 111611 hands, and dismiffed to enjoy·
the honour of his divine triumph. The Arians celebrated the virtue
of their pious confeffor3 the catholics ambitioussy 'claimed his
alliance¹⁰⁰; and the Pagans, who might be susceptibleof {hamc or
remorse‚ were deterred from the repetition of such unavailing
but if the bissmp of Arethusa

‚ posterity will condemn the in-

cruelty¹⁰¹. Julian spared his life:

graffiude, instead of praising the clemency, of the emperor.

Daphne.

At the distance of five miles from Antioch, the Macedonian kings
of Syria had consecrated to Apollo one of the most elegant *places of

devotion in the Pagan vvorld ¹⁰³.

⁹⁹ The sufferings and constancy of Mnrk,
which Gregory has so tragically painted
(Orat. iii. p. 88—91.)‚ are confirmed by the

unexceptionable and reluetant evidence of

'Wolfius (ad loc.) have explained a Greek
word, whose true signification had been mis-
taken by former interpreter-s, and even by
le Clerc (Bibliotheque Ancienne et Modernwe‚
tom. iii. p. 371·)- Yet Tillemont is strange-

could mistake a Semi-Asiam bishop fora saint.

banius intercedes for a fimilar offender, Vlest
they should find many Marks; yet he allows,
that if Orion had secretcd the consecrated
wealth, he deser-ved to suffer the punishment
of Marsyam to be flayed alive (Epist. 730
P· ¹³49-351·-)

²Gregory (Orat iii. p. 90. )is satisfied,
that by saving the apostate, Mark had de-

lerv ed still more than he had suffered.

described by Strabo (1. xvi( p. 1089, 1090.
edit. Amstel. 1707.)‚ Libanius (Naenia, p.
135-188. Antiochic. Orat. xi. p. 380, 381.),
and Sozomen (l. ν. e. 19.). VVesseling (Iti-
nerar. p. 581.), and casaubon (ad Hist. Au-
gust. p. 64.) illustrate this curious subjeft.
