fian Anunianus, who delivers his impartial sense in these expreffive C {lxi} P.
words: “ The praefedmre of Juveutius was accompanied with peace W...)

“ und plenty: but the tranquillity of his govermnent was soon dis-

tu1·bed by a bloody sedition of the dist1·a&ed people.

“ The ardour

‘'‘ of Damasus and Urfinus, to seize the episcopal seat, surpafl'Cd the

K<

ordinary measure of human ambit-ion. They contendet! with the

‘⁶ ruge of party5 the quarrel was maintained by the wounds and
death of their follov‘fers3 and the praefe&‚ unable to rellst or to

appease the tumult, was constrained, by superior violence, to re-

‘L

‘⁶ tire into the suburbe.

Damasus prevailed: the well-(lisputed vic—

tory remained on the fide of his faffion ; one hundred and thirty-

ιι 82

seven dead bodies ²³¹ were found in the Btgfilica of Sicinium ,

“ where the Christians hold their relig10us affemblie53 and it *aas

‘⁶ long before the angry minds of the people resumed their accustomed

tranquillity. W'hen I confider the splendour of the capital, l am

‘⁶ not astonished that so valuable a prize should inflame the Aelim

of ambitious men, and produce the fiercest and most obstinate

“ eontests.

riched by the offerings of matrons ⁸³3 that, as soon as his drest ix

⁴⁶ his charior, through the streets of Rome ⁸⁴3 and, that the sump-

‘⁸ tuousnc‘ss of the Imperial table will not equal the profuse and

⁰¹ Jerom himselfis forced to allow, cru-
deliffimae interfeffiones diverfi sexus perpe-
trstae (in Chron. p. 186.). But an original
libel or petition of two presbyters of the ad-
verse party, has unaccountably escaped. They
affirm, that the doors ofthe Bafflicawere bus-nt,
and that the roos was untiled; thatDamasus
marched at the head ofhis own clergy, grave-
diggers, charioteers, and hired gladiators3
that none of his party were killed, but that
one hundred and fixty dead bodies were
found. This petit-ion is published by the P.
Sirmond, in the first volume of his works.
