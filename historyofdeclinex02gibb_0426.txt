THE DECLINE AND FALL

After the tumult of Alexandria had subfided, Athanasius, amidst
the public acclamations, seated himself 011 1116 throne from whence
his unworthy competitor had been precipitated: and as the zeal of
the archbishop was tempered with discretion, the exercise of his au-
thority tended not to inflame, but to reconcile, the minds of the
people. His pastoral labours were not confirmed to the narrow limits
of Egypt. The state of the Christian world was present to his active
and capacious mind ; and the age, the merit, the reputation of Atha-
nasius, enabled him to afl'ume, in a moment of danger, the office of
Ecclefiastical Dinator ¹²⁹. Three years were not yet elapsed since the
majority of the bishops of the West had ignorantly, or reluctantly,
subscribed, the Conseffion of Rimini. They repented, they believed,
but they dreaded the unseasonable rigour of their orthodox brethren;
and if their pride was stronger than their faith, they might throw

themselves into the arms of the Ariane, to escape the indignity οἱ ,ει

,public penance, which must degrade them to the condition of ob-

scure laymen. At the same time, the domestic differences concerning
1116 11111011 and distinction of the divine persons, were agitated with
some heat among the Catholic doctors; and the progress of this me-
taphysical controversy seemed to threaten a public and lasting division
of the Greek and Latin churches. ἔγ 1116 wisdom of ι1161681 synod,
to which the name and presence of Athanasius gave the authority of
a general council, the bissiops, who had unwarily deviated into error,
were admitted to the communion of the chureh, on the easy con-
dition os still-seribing the Nicone Crced ; without any formal acknow-
ledgment of their past fauit, or any minute definition of their scho-
lastic opinions. The advice of the primate of Egypt had already
prepared the clergy cf Gaul and Spain, of Italy and Goeece, for the
