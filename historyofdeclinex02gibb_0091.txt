the Lzstral contribution: and the historian Zolixnus ¹³⁹ lamenta
that the approach of the fatal period was announced by the
tears and tem-ors of the citizens, who were osten compelled by
the impending scourge to embrace the most abhorred and un-
natural methods of procuring the sum at which their poverty had
been affeffed. The testimony of Zosimus cannot indeed bc jus-
tified from the charge of paffion and prejudice‚ but, from the
nature of this tribute, it seems reasonable to conclude that it was
arbitrary in the distribution, and extremely rigorous inthe mode of
collefiing. The secret wealth of commeme, and the precarious
profits of art or labour, are susceptible only os a discretionary xu-
luation, which is seldom disadvantageous to the interest of the
treasury3 and as the person of the trader supplies the want of a
vifible and permanent secursty, the payment of the impolition,
which, in the case of a land-tax, may be obtained by the seizure of
property, can rarely be extorted by any other means than *those of
corporal punishments. The cruel treatment of the insolvent debtors
of the state, is attested, and was perhaps mitigated by a very
