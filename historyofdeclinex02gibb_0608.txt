THE DECLINE AND FALL

CHAP.

prevailed in the bloody contest: the king of the Alani was {lain}
and the remains of the vanquished nation were dispersed by the or-

dinary alternative of flight or submiffion ⁵⁵. A colony of exiles found

a secure refuge in the mount-ains of Caucasus, between the Euxine
and the Caspian3 where they stillrpreserve their name and their inde-
pendence. Another colony advanced, with more intrepid courage, to-

wards the shores of the Baltic ; associated themselves with the Northern
tribes of Germany3 and shared the spoil of the Roman provinces of

Gaul and Spain. But the greatest part of the nation of the Alani
embraced the offers of an honourable and advantageous union: and
the Huns, who esteemed the valour of their less fortunate enemies,
proeeeded, with an increase of numbers and confidence, to’invade
the limits of the Gothic empire.

cruelty of the Huns, were felt, and dreaded‚ and magnified, by
the astoniihed Goths; who beheld their fields and villages consumed

To these
real terrors they added, the surprise and abhorrence which were ex*

cited by the shrill voice, the uncouth gestures, and the strange de-

with flames, and deiuged with indiscriminate ssaughter.

⁵⁶ As we are possessed of the authentic his-
tory of the Huns, it would be impertinent
to sepem, or to refute, the fables, which

misrepresent thei'r origin and progress, their
