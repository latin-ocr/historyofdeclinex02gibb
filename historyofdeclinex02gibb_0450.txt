THE DECLINE AND FALL

The ordinary post of Julian was at the head of the centre column ;
but as he preferred the dutics of a general to the state of a monarch,
he rapidly moved, with a small escort of light cavalry, to the front,
thc rear, the Hwks, wherever his presence could animate or prote&
rhe march of the Roman army. The country which they traversed
from the Chaboras, to the cultivated lands of Assyria, may be con-
sidered as a part of the desert of Arabia, a dry and barren waste,
which could never be improved by the most powerful arts of hu-
man industry. Julian marched over the same ground which had
been trod above seven hundred years before by the footsteps of the
youngerx Cyrus, and which is described by one of the companions of
his expedition, ⁴the fage and heroic Xenophon⁴⁷. ‘⁶ The country
“ was a plain throughout, as even as the sea, and full of worm-

desert was frequently raised by the wind into clouds of dust : and a
great number os the soldiers of Julian, with their tems, vvere sud-
denly thrown to the ground by the violence of an [inexpecled

hurricane.
