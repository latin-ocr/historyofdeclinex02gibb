The complaints and mutual accusations which affailed the throne
of Constantine, as soon as the death of Maxentius had submitted
Africa to his viC’mrious arms, were ill adapted to edify an imperfe&
proselyte. He learned, with surprise, that the provinces of that
great country, from the confines of Cyrene to the columns of
Hercules, were distracted with religious discord ⁶. The source of

fiastical history may be found in the edition
of Optatus Milevitanus, published (Paris

original records, and an accurate abridge-

greatest part ofavolume (tom. vi. parti.) :
and I am indebted to him for an ample col-

Augustin, which relate to those heretics.
