OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 365

“ The devout and fearless curiosity of Julian tempted the philo- ΟΧἙΞῙῇιΡ·

sophers with the hopes of an easy conquest3 which, from the x--v--a
ν situation of their young proselyte, might be produzffive of the ζῗέῑέῑῃθῆἳί-
most important consequences²³‚ Julian imbibed the first rudi· c'ism of Ju-
ments of the Platonic doctrines from· the mouth of AEdesius, han.
who had fixed at Pergamus his wandering and persecuted

school. But as the declining strength of that venei-able suge was

unequal to the ardour, the diligence, the rapid conception of his

pupil, two of ‘his most learned disciples‚ Chrysanthes and Eusebius,
supplied, at his own desire, the place of their aged master. These
philosophers seem to have prepared and distributed their respeffiffive

part33 and they artfully contrived, by dark hints, and affe-&ted dis-

putes, to excite the impatient hopes of the (spirant, till they deli-

vered him into the hands of their afl‘ociate Maximus, the boldest and

most ikilful master of the Theurgic science. By his hande, Julian

was secretly initiated at Ephesus, in the twentieth year of his age.

His resldence at Athens confirmed this unnatural alliancc of philo-

sophy and superstition. He obtained the privilege of a solemn
initiation into the mysteriep of Eleusis, which, amidst the general

decay of the Grecian worship, still retained some vestiges of their
primaeval saiiCtity3 and such was the zeal of Julian, that he after-

warde} invited the Eleusiniam pontiffto the court of Gaul, for the sole

purpose of consummating, by mystic rites :md sacrifices, the great

work of his sanctification. As these ceremonies were performed in

t-‹he depth of cavei-ns, and in the silence of the night 3 and as the in—

,violable secret of the mysteries was preserved by the discretion os

ν the initiated, Ι shall not presume to describe the horrid sounds, and
