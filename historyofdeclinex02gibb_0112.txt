revenge, the Gothic kings aspired to extend their dominion from the
Euxine to the frontiers of Germany ς and the waters of the Μᾶγος,

of the contending Barbarians. After some experience of the supe-
rior strength and numbers of their adversaries, the Sarmatians
implored the protection of the Roman Monarch, who beheld with

the progress of the Gothic arms. As soon as Constantine had
