OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

His salutary influence restored the cities of Gaul, which had been
so long exposed to the evils of civil discord, Barbarian war, and
domestic tyranny; and the spirit of industry was revived with the
hopes of enjoyment. Agriculture, manufacftures and commerce again
flourished under the protection of the laws; and the curiae, or civil
corporations‚ were again filled with useful and respefitable members:
the youth were no longer apprehensive os marriage; and married
persons -were no longer apprehenfive of posterity: the public and
private festivals were celebrated with customary pomp ; and the fre-
quent and secure intercourse of the provinces displayed the image of
national prosperity ⁹¹. A mind like that of Julian, must have felt the
general happiness of which he was the author-3 but he viewed, with

1 peculiar satisfa&ion and complacency, the city of Paris; the seat of

his winter refidence, and the object even of his partial affe&i011 ⁹².
That splendid capital, which now embraces an ample territory on
either side of the Seine, was originally confined to the small issand
in the midst of the river, from whence the inhabitants derived a
supply of pure and salubrious water. The river bathed the foot of
the walls3 and the town was aceessible only by two wooden bridgeS.
A forest overspread the northern side of the Seine3 but on the south,
the ground, which now bears the name of the University‚ was insen-
sibly covered with houses, and adorned with a palace and amphithe—
atre, baths‚ an aquedudh and a field of Mars sor the exercise of the
Roman troops. The severity of the climate was teinpered by the
neighbourhood of the ocean3 ancl with some precautions, which ex-

perience had taught, the vine and fig-tree were successfully cultivated„
