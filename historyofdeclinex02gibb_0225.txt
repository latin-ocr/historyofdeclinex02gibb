rigour might have blasted the unripened fruits of his conversion 3 and
if the door-s of the church had been strictly closed against a prince
who had deserted the altars of the gods, the master of the empire
would have been left destitute of any form of religious worship, In
his last vifit to Rome, he pioufly disclaimed and insulted the super-
stition of his ancestors‚ by refusing to lead the military proceflion of
the equestrian order, and to offer the public vows to the Jupiter of
the Capitoline Hill⁶⁵. Many years before his baptism and death,
Constantine had proclaimed to the world‚ that neither his person nor
his image ffiould ever more be seen within the walls of an idolatrous-
temple3 while he distributed through the provinces a variety of
medals and pictures, which represented the emperor in an humble
and suppliant posture of Christian devotion ⁶⁵.

The pride of Constantine, who refused the privileges of a cate-
chumen, cannot easily be explained or excused ; but the delay of his
baptism may be justified by the maxims and the praefice of ecclesi-
astical antiquity. The sacrament of baptism ⁶⁷ was regularly admi-
nistered by the bishop himself, with his affistant clergy‚ in the ca—
thedral church of the diocese, during the fifty days between the som
lemn festivals of Easter and Pentecost; and this holy term admitted
a numerous band of infants and adult persons into the bosom of
the church. The discretion of parents often suspended the baptism
of their children till they could' understand the obligations which they
contracted: the severity of ancient bilhops exaC’ted from the new
