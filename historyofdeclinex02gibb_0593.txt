duty of a Tartar sovereign to lead his warlike subjects into the field, C H A P.

XXVI.

the claims of an infant are often disregarded3 and some royal z--v——sa

kinsman, distinguished by his age and valour, is entrusted with the
sword and sceptre of his predecessbr. Two distinet and regular taxes-
are levied on the tribes, to support the dignity of their nationali
monarch, and of their peculiar chief 3. and each of those contribu-
tions. amounts to the tythe, both of their property, and of their
spoil. A Tartar sovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of
his people3 and as his own domestic riches of flocks and herds
increase in a much larger proportion, he is able plentifully to main-
tain the rustic splendor of his court, to reward the most deserving,
or the most favoni-ed, of his followers, and to obtain, from the
gentle influence of corruption, the obedience which might be some-
times refused to the stern mandates of authority. The manners of
his subjeosts, aceustomed, like himself, to blood and rapine, might
excuse, in their eyes, such partial aGts of tyranny, as would excite
the horror, of a civilised people 3 but the power of a despot has never
been acknowledged in the deserts of Scythia. The immediate juris-
diction of the Khan is confined within the limits of his own tribe 3 and
the exercise of his royal prerogative has been moderated by the an-
cient institution of a national council. The Coroultai¹⁴‚ or Diet, of
the Tantam, -was regularly held in the spring and autumn, in the midst
of a plain ; where the princes of the reigning family, and the mursas
of the respeihve tribes, may conveniently affemble on horseback,
with their martial and numerous trains; and the ambitious monarch,
who reviewed the strength, must consult the inclinaston, of an armed

people. The rudiments of a feudal government may be discovered
in the constitution of the Scythiam or Tartar nations3 but the per-
