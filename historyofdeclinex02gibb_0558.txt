THE DECLINE AND FALL

'the Moo'rish tyram, after wine had extinguished the sense of danger, dis·-
appointed the insulting triumph of the Romans, by strangling himself
in the night. His dead body, the only present which Igmazen could
offer to the conqueror, was carelessly thrown upon a camel x and
Theodofius‚ leading back his victorious troops to sitifi, was saluted
by the warniest acclamations of joy and loyalty ¹²³.

Africa had been lost by the vices of Romanus; it was restored by
the virtues of Theodosius: and our curiosity may be usefully directe'd

to the inquiry of the respective treatment, 'which the two generals

¹'received from the Imperial court. The authority of count Romanus

had been suspended hythe master-general of the cavalry3 and he
was· committed to safe and honourable custody till the end of the
war. His crimes were proved by the most authentic evidence3 and
the public expedied, with some impatience, the decree of severe justice.
But the partial and powerful 'favour of Mellobaudes‘eneouraged him
to challenge his legal judges, to obtain repeated delays‘for the purpose
of procuring a crowd of friendly witneffes‚ and, finally, to cover his
guilty condu&‚ by the additional guilt of fraud and forgery. · About
the same time, the restorer of Britain and Africa, on a vagne suspi-

cion, that his name and services were superior to the rank of a subjeet,
was ignominioussy beheaded at Cartha-ge. Valentinian no longer

reigned3 and the death of Theodoffim, as well as the impunity of
Romanus, mayjustly be imputcd to the arts of the minister-s who

abused the confidence, and deceived the inexperienced youth, of his
sonam.

If the geographical accuracy of Ammianus had been fortunately
bestowed on the Eritiih exploits of Theodosius,¹ we should have
