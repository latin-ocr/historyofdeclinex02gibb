“ there are many chiefs, whose merit ‘and experience are equal to

resolution of Julian was answered by the unanimous applause and

“ Perfians under the yoke!'' ‘⁶ Thus may I restore the strength

paffion of his soul: but it was not before he trampled on the ruins
of Maogamalcha, that he allowed himself to say, “ We have now
