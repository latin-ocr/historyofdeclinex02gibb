the whole episcopal body was ordered to march. The Eastern coum-⁴
cil, after consuming four days in fierce and unavailing (lebate, separated
without any definitive conclufion. The council of the West was pro-
traded till the seventh mouth. Taurus, the l'raetorian praeseft, was iri-
struGoed not to dismiss the prelates till they ihould all be united in the
same opinion ; and his efforts were supported by a power of banishing
