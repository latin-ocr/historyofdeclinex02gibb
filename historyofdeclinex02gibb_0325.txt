OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

accuses the timid prudence of Montesquieu, for negleffi‘cing to enume-
rate, among the causes of the decline of the empire, a law of Con-
stantine, by which the exercise of the pagan worship was abso-
lutely suppreffed, and a confiderable part of his subjecte was left
destitute of priests, of temples‚ and of any public religion. The zeal
ofthe philosophie historian for the rights of mankind, has induced him
to acquiesce in the ambiguous testimony of those ecclefiastics‚ who
have too lightly ascribed to their favourite hero the merit of a gc—

neral persecution ¹⁵⁹.

Instead of alleging this imaginary law, which
would have blazed in the front of the Imperial codes, we may
safely appeal to the original epistle‚ which Constantine addreffed to
the followers of theancient religion3 at a time when hc no longer
disguised his conversion, nor (lreaded the rivals of his throne. He
invites and exhorts‚ in the most pressing ternus, the subjects of the
Roman empire to imitate the example of their master3 but he de-
clares, that those who still refuse to open their eyes to the celestial
light, may freely enjoy their temples, and their fancied gods. A
report‚ that the ceremonies of paganismi were supmeffed, i>— formally
cont1⁴adi&e(l by the emperor himself, who wisely asligns, as the
principle of his moderatiori, the invincible force of habit, of preju-
dice, and of superstition ¹⁶³. without violating the sanclity of his
promise, without alarming the fcars of the pagans, the artful monarch
advanccd, by ssow and cautious steps, to undcrmine the irregular
and decaycd fabric of polytheism. The partial adis of severity which
