576 THE DECLINE AND FALL
foggffff' verisy a series of near two thousand years, by the perpetual testimony
t--v-—a of accurate and contemporary historians ²⁴. The annals of ²⁵ China

illustrate the state and revolutions of the pastoral tribes, which may
still be distinguished by the vague appellation of Scythiam, or Tar-
tars; the valsals, the enemies, and sometimes the conquerors, of a
great empire3 whose policy has uniformly opposed the blind and
impetuous valour of the Barbarians os the North. From the
mouth of the Danube to the sea of Japan, the whole longitude
of Scyt-hia is about one hundred and ten degrees, which, in that

Siberia. In that dreary climate, instead os the animated pieture of a

ence arises from the uncertain duration of

the two first dynasties; and the vacant space
that lies beyond thern, as far as the real, or
sabulous, times of Fohi, or Hoangti. Se-
matfien dates his authentic chronology from
the year 841 : the thirty-six eclipses of Con-
fucius (thirty-one of which have been veri-
rfied) were observed between the years 722 and

480 before Christ. The historica! period of

China does not ascend above the Greek
Olympiads.

²⁴ After several ages of anarchy and de-
spofism, the dynasty of the Han (before

Christ 206.) was the aera of the revival of

learning. The fragments of ancient litera-
ture were restored3 the charaeters were im-
proved and fixed ; and the future preservation
os books was secured⁷ by the useful inventions
of ink, paper, and the art ofprinting. Niue-
sy-seven years before Christ, Sematfien pub·

lished the first history of China. His labours
were illustrated, and continued, by a series
of one hundred and eighty historians. The
substance of their works is still extant3 and
the most considerable of them are now depo-
fited in the king of France's libre-ry.

and Mem-s. Freret, and de Guignes, at *Pa-
