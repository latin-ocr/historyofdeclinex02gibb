which the produce of the land is claimed by one party, as his exclu-
sive property3 is used by another as a lucrative 0leect of trade;
and is required by a third, for the daily and necessary support of life ;
all the profits of the intermediate agents are accumulated on the
head of the defenceless consumers. The hardssiips of their fituation
were exaggerated and encreased by their own impatience and anxiety13
and the apprehenfion of a scarcity gradually produced the appear-
ances of a famine. When the luxurious citizens of Antioch com-
plained of the high price of poultry and fifh, Julian publicly declared,
that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular supply of wine,
oil, and bread5 but he acknowledged that it was the duty of a sove-
reign to provide for the sublistence of his people. With this salu-
tary view, the emperor ventui-ed on a very danger-eus and doubtful
step, of fixing, by legal authority, the valae of corn. He enadhzd, that ¹
in a time of searcity, it should be sold at a price which had seldom
been known in the most plentiful years3 and that his own example
might strengthen his Ιῑικνε,ι he sent into the market four hundred and
twenty-two thousand modii, or measures, which were drawn, by his
order, from the granaries of 'Hierapolis‚ of Chalcis, and even of
Egypt. The consequences might have been foreseen, and were soon
felt. The Imperial wheat was purchased hythe rich merchants; the
proprietors of land, or of corn, withhelcl from the city the accustomed
supply3 and the small quantities that appeared in the market, were
secretly sold at an advanced and illegal price. Julian still continued
to applaud his own policy, treated the complaints of the people as
a vain and ungrateful murmur, and convinced Antioch, that he had
inherited tie obstinacy, though not the cruelty‚ of his brother Gal-
