cian philosophy, he was named Praetorian
praefect of Italy, in the year 397. S. While
he still exercised that great office, he was
created, in the year 399, consul for the
West; and his name, on account of the in-
famy of his colleague, the eunuch Eutropius,
often stands alone in the Fasti. 9. In the
year 408, Mallius was appointed a second
time Praetorian praefest of Italy. Even in
the venal pancgyric of Claudian, we may
discover the merit of Mallius Theodorus,
who, by a rare felicity, was the intimate
friend both of Symmachus and of St. Au-
gustin. See Tillemont, Hist. des Emp. tom.
