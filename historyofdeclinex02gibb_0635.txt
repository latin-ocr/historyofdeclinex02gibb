OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

of foot, encompaffed, on an open plain, by superior numbers of horse:
but the troops of Valens, oppress'ed by the weight of the enemy and their
own fears, were crowded into a narrow space, where it was impoffible
⁷ for them to extend their ranks, or even to use, with effect, their

swords and javelins. In the midst of tumult, of {lang-liter, and of

dismay, the emperor, delcrted by his guards, and wounded‚ as it
was supposed, with an arrOW, fought protection among the Lancearii
and the Mattiarii‚ who still maintained their ground with some ap-
pearance of order and firmness. His faithful generals, Trajan and
Victor, who perceived his danger, loudly exclaimcd‚ that all was lost,
unless the person of the emperor could be saved. Some troops, ani-
mated by their exhortation, advanecd to his relies: they⁴found only
a bloody spot, covered with a heap of broken arms, arrd mangled
bodies, without being able to discover their unfortunate prince‚ either
among the living, or the dead. Their search could not indeed be
successful, if there is any truth in the circumstances, with which
some historiatis have related the death of the emperor. By the care
of his attendants, Valens was removed from the field of battle to a
neighbouring cottage, where they attempted to dress his wound, aud
to provide for his future safety. But this humble retreat was instantly
surrounded by the enemy: they tried to force the door 3 they were pro-
voked by a discharge of arrows from the roof ; till at length, impa-
tient of delay, they set fire to apile of dry saggots, and consumed the
cottage‚ with the Roman emperor and his train. Valens perish-
ed in the fiames3 and a youth who dropt from the window, aione
escaped, to attest the melancholy tale, and to inform the Goths of the
inestimable prize which they had lost by their own rassmess. A great
number of brave and distinguiihed officere perished in the battle of
Hadrianople, which equalled, in the actual loss, and far surpass'ed, in
the fatal consequences‚ the missortune which Rome had formerly
