32 THE DECLINE AND FALL

&sistit ili-:y resigned the jurisdic‘iion which they had hitherto claimed and
’.Λ-..μ exercised over all the departments of the palace. They were de·
prix-ed by Constantine of all military command, as soon as they had
ccased to lead into the field, under their immediate orders, the flower
of the Roman troops; and at length, by a singular revolution, the
captaius of the guards were transforined into the civil magistrates of
the provinces. According to the plan of government instituted by
Diocletiani, the four princes had each their Praetorian praefect3 and,

Illyricum. 3. The power of the praese& of Italy was not confined

over the dependent issands of the Medkerranean, and over that part
of the continent of Africa which lies between the confines of Cyrene
and those of Tingitania. 4. The praefect of the Gauls compre-
