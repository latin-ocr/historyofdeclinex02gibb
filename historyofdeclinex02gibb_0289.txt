'the Trinity‚ to whose defence he consecrated every moment and C {X}- P.
every faculty of his being. Educated in the family of Alexander, k--v--J
he had vigoroussy opposed the early progress of the Arian heresy‘z>

he exercised the important funffions of lecretary under the aged pre÷

late3 and the fathers of the Nicene council beheld with surprise and

respefih the rising virtues of the young deacon. In a time of

public danger, the dull claims of age and of rank are sometimes su-

perseded3 and within five mouths after his return from Nice, the

(leacon Athanasius was seated on the archiepiscopal throne of Egypt.

He filled that eminent station above forty-fix years, and his long A.D. 3²6-
administration was spent in a perpetual combat against the powers of 373·
Arianism. Five times was Athanasius expelled from his throne3

twenty years he passed as an exile or a fugitive3 and almost every

province os the Roman empire was succeffively witness to his merit,

and his sufferings in the cause of the Homoousion, which he con-

fidered as the sole pleasure and business, as the duty, and as the glory,

of his life. Amidst the storms of persecution, the arehbissiop of
Alexandria was patient of labour, jealous of fame, careless of safetyg

and although his mind was tainted by the contagion of fanaticism‚
Athanasius displayed a superiority of chara&er and abilities, which

would have qualified him, far better than the degenerate sons of
Constantine, for the government of a great monarchy. His learning

was much less profound and extensive than that of Eusebius of

Caesarea, and his rude eloquence could not be compared with the

polished oratory of Gregory or Basxl 3· but whenever the pri-mate> of

Egypt was called upon to justify his sentiments or his conduct, his
unpremeditated style, either of speaking or wriffing, was clear, for-

cible‚ and persuafive. He has always been revered in the orthodox
