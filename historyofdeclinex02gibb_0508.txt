had never been exercised in any employment‚ military 01· civil 3 and
his chara-<ster had not inspired the world with any sanguine expedia·-
tions. He possessed, however, one quality, which recommended

fully acknowledged in every aetion of his life ²²³.

Before Valentinian divided the provinces, he resormed the ad-
ministration of the empire. All ranks of subjeets, who had been
injurcd or oppreffed under the reign of Julian, were invited to
support their public accusations. The silence of mankind at-
tested the spotless integrity of the prcese& Sallust²⁹; and his own
prefling solicitations‚ that he might be permitted to retire from the
business of the state, were reje&ed by Valentinian with the most
honourable expressions of friendship and esteem. But among the

teeted either by favour or justice ³⁰. The greater part of the mi-

whole proceedings of this delicate *enquiry appear to have been con-
dusted with a reasonable share of wisdom and mocleration³¹. The
