The nat-ions, and the fecis, of
the Roman world, admitted with equal credulity, and fimilarabhor-
renco, the reality of that infernal art μ’, which was able to controul
the eternal order of the planete, and the voluntary operations of the
human mind. They dreaded the mysterious power of spells and
incantations, of potent herbs, and execrable rites; which could
extinguish or recall life, inflame the paffions of the soul, blast the
works of eleation, and extort from the reluctant daemons the secrets

>of futurity. They believed, with the wildest inconfisteney, that this

praeternatural dominion of the air, of earth, and of hell, was exer-
effeci, from the vilest mo'tives of malice or gain, by some wrinkled
hags, and itinerant sorcerers, who passed their obscure lives in pe·-
nury and contempt ⁴⁷. The asts of magic were equally condemned
by the public opinion, and by the laws of Rome3 but as they
tended to gratify the most imperious paffsons of the heart of man,
vthey were continually proselibed, and continually praelised ⁴⁸. An
imaginary cause is capable of producing the most serious and mis-

-chievous effects. The dark prediffions of the death of an emperor,
