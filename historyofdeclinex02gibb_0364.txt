THE DECLINE AND FALL

“ I do not mean to apply that epithet to my brother Constantius.

·“ He is no more3 may the earth lie light on his head! But his

‘⁶ artfuland cruel favoni-ires studied to deceive and exasperate a prince,
“ whose natural mildness cannot be praised without some efforts of
“ adulation. It is not, however, my intention, that even those men
“ should be oppressed: they are accused, and they shall enjoy the
“ benelit of a fair and impartial trial.” To conduct this enquiry‚‘
Julian named lix judges of the highest rank in the state and army3
and as he wilhed to escape the reproach of condemning his personal
encmies, he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at Chalcedon, on the
Afiatic fide of the Bosphorus; and transferred to the commiffioners
an absolute power to pronounce and execute their final sentence,
without delay, and without appeal. The³ office of &president was
exercised by the venerable praefe& of the East, a stcond Sallust ⁶³,
whose virtues conciliated the esteem of Greek sophists‚ and of Chris-
tian bilhops. He was assisted by the eloquent Mamertinus ⁶¹, one of
the consuls elect, whose merit is loudly celebrated by the doubtful
evidence of his own applause. But the civil wisdom of two ma-

’ gistrates was overbalanced by the ferocious violence of four generals,

Nevitta, Agilo, Jovinus‚ and Arbetio. Arbetio, whom the public

= would have seen with less surprise at the bar than on the bench, was

supposed to poffess the secret of the commiffion ; the armed and angry
leaders of the Jovian and Herculian hands encompaffed the tribunal;

rand the judges were alternately swayed by the laws of justice, and
by the clainours of faciion ⁶². ⁵
