OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 345

The chamberlain Eusebius, who had so long abused the favour of C gns} P.

, Constantius, expiated, by an ignominious death, the insolence, the ³-7-2——1
corruption, and cruelty of his servile reign. The executions of Paul Ξὲἳῖἒᾞῖζᾏ-
and Apodemius (the former of whom was burnt alive) were accepted {31:5de the
as an inadequate atonement by the widows and orphans of so many
hundred Romans, whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and mur-
dercd. But Justice herself (if we may use the pathetic expreflion of
Ammianus ⁶³) appeared to weep over the fate of Ursulus, the trea—
surcr of the empire; and his blood accused the ingratitude of
Julian, whose distress had been seasonably relieved by the intrepid
liberality of that honest minister. The rage of the soldiers, whom
he had pro-voked by his indiscretion, was the cause and the excuse of
his death ; and the emperor, deeply wounded by his own reproaches
and those of the public, offered some consolation to the family of
Ursulus, by the restitution of his *confiscated fortunes. Before the
end of the year in which they had been adorned with the enfigns of
the prefec‘hlre and consulship ⁶⁴, Taurus and Florentius were reduced
to implore the clemency of the inexorable tribunal of Chalcedon.
The former was banissied to Vercellae in Italy, and a sentence of
death was pronounced against the latter. A wife prince should
have rewarded the crime of Taurus: the faithful minister, when
he was no longer able to oppose the progress of a rebel, had taken
refuge in the court of his benefacfi'mr and his lawful sovereign.
But the guilt of Florentiusjustified the severity of thejudges3 and his
escape served to display the magnanimity ofJulian3 who nobly checked

the interested diligence of an informer, and refused to learn what place

⁶³ Ursuli vcro necem ipsa mihi videtur the public was surprised aad scandalized to
flesse justitia. Libanim, who imputes his hear Taurus summoned as a criminal under
death to the soldiem attempts to criminate the consulship of Taurus. The summons of

venerable names of the commonwcalth, that year.
