oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 7

Hellespont is about one hundred and twenty miles. Those who C H A P.

steer their westward course through the middle of the Propontis, :gl—³

may at once descry the high lands of Thrace and Bithynia, and never
lose sight of the lofty summit of Mount Olympus, covered withx
eternal snows ¹4. They leave on the left a deep gulf, at the bottom

of which Nicomedia was seated, the imperial rcfidence of Diocletian;.
and they pass the small illands of Cyzicus and Proconnesus b‘efore they
cast anchor at Gallipoli: where the sea, which separates Afia from
Europe, is again commeted into a narrow charmel.

The gcographers who, with the most sseilful accuracy, have sur- The Heliae
veyed the form and extent of the Hellespont‚ aflign about fixty miles spo’m
for the winding course, and about three miles for the ordinary
breadth of those celebrated streights¹⁵. But the narrowest part of
the charmel is found to the northward of the old Turkilh castles
between the cities os Sestus and Abydus. It was here that the ad-
venturous Leander braved the pass'age of the flood for the poffeflion of
his mistress ¹⁶. It was here likewise, in a place where the distance·
κ between'the opposite banks cannot exceed five hundred paces, that
Xerxes imposed a stupendous bridge of boats, for the purpose of trans--
porting into Europe an hundred and seventy myriads of barba-

'4 Thevenot (Voyages au Levant, part i. pofing new, and perhaps imaginary mea-

l. i. c. 14.) contrac‘ts the measure to 125 fieres, for the purpose of rendering ancient

small Greek miles. Belou (Observcuions,
1. ii. c. 1.) gives a good description of the
Propontis, but contents himself with the
vague expression of one day and one night⁷s
sail. When Sandys (Travels, p. 21.) talks
of 150 furlongs in length as well as breadth,
we can only suppose some mistake of the press
in the text of that judicious traveller.

¹³ See an admirable dissertation os M. d’An-
ville upon the Hellespont or Dardanelles, in
the Memoires de l'Acadernie des Inscriptions‚
tom. xxviii. p. 318—346. Yet even that
ingenious geographer is too fond of sup-

writers as accurate as himself. The stadia
employed by Herodotus in the description of
the Euxine, the Bosphorus, Sec. (l. iv. ct
85.) must undoubtedly be all of the same
species: but it seems impossible to reconcile
them either with truth or with each other.

¹⁶ The oblique distance between Sellus
and Abydus was thirty stadia. The impro-
bable tale of Hero and Leander is exposed
by M. Mahudel, but is defended on the au-
thority of poets and medals by M. de la.
Nauze. see the Academie des hscffipffions,
tom. vii. Hist. p. 74. Mem. p. 240.
