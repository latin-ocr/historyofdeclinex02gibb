Mount Sion: on the north fide, the buildings ‘of the lower town co- ι--Ὗ--α
vered the spacious summit os Mount Acra3 and a part of the hill,

distinguished by the name of Moriah‚ and levelled by human in-
dustry, was crowned with the stately temple of the Jewilh nation.
After the final destruction of the temple, by the arms of Titus and
Hadrian, a ploughshare was drawn over the consecrated ground, as-

a sign of perpetual interdiction. Sion was deserted : Β and the vacant
space of the lower city was filled with the public and private edi-
fices of the AElian colony, which spread themselves over the adjacent
hill of Calvary. The holy places were polluted with monuments of
· idolatry3 and, either from defign or accident, a chapel was dedicated
to Venus, on the spot which had been sanctified by the death and
resurrection of Christ ⁶⁰. Almost three hundred years after those
stupendous events, the profane chapel of Venus was demolilhed by
the order of Constantine3 and the removal of the earth and stones
revealed the holy sepulchre to the eyes of mankind. A magnificent
church was erected on that mystic ground, by the first Christian em-
peror; and the effects of his pious munificence were extended to

every spot, which had been consecrated by the footsteps of patriarchs,
of prophets‚ and of the Son of God⁶¹.
