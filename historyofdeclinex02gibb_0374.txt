his immortal fame. When we inspect‚ with minute, or perhaps
malevolent attention, the portrait of Julian, something seems want-
ing to the grace and perfedfion of the whole figure. His genius
was less powerful and sublime than that of Caesar3 nor did he possess
the consummate prudenee of Augustus. The virtues of Trajan
appear more steady and natural, and the philosophy of Marcus is
more slmple and consistent. Yet Julian sustained adverfity with
firmness, and prosperity with moderation. After an interval of one

hundred and twenty years from the death of Alexander Severus, the
Romans beheld an emperor who made no distinction between his
duties and his pleasures; who laboured to relieve the distress‚ and to
revive the spirit, of his subjeet53 and who endeavoured always to
conne& authority with merit, and happiness with virtue. Even
faetion, and religious faC’tion‚ was constrained to acknowledge the
superiority of his genius, in peace as well as in war3 and to con-

sess, with a 1]th that the apostate Julian was a lover of his country,
and that he'deserved the empire of the world ⁸⁵.
