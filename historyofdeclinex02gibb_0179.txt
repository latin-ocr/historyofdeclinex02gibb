OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

again dispatched to the frontier of Mesopotamia, and condemned to
sustain the labours of a war, the honours of Which had been trans-
ferred to his unworthy rival. Sabinian fixed his indolent station
under the walls of Edessa, and while he amused himself with the
idle parade of military exereise‚ and moved to the sound of flutes
in the Pyrrhic dance, the public defence was abandoned to the bold-
ness and diligence of the former general of the East. But whenever
Ursicinus recommended any vigorous plan of operations; when he
proposed, at the head of a light and affilive army, to wheel round
the foot of the mountains, to intercept the convoys of the enemy, to
'haras-s the wide extent of the Persian lines, and to relieve the
distress of Amida; the timid and envious commander alleged,
that he was restrained by his politive orders from endangering the
safety of the troops. Amida was at length taken ; its bravest de-

Roman camp by the hand of the executioner3 and Urlieinus himself,
after supporting the disgrace of a parti-ul enquiry, was punilhed for the
miscondud‘t of Sabinian by the loss of his military rank. But Con-

indignation had extorted from his injured lientenant, that as long as
such maxims of government were suffered to prevail, the emperor
himself would find it no easy talk to defend his eastern dominions
from the invafion of a foreign enemy. XVhen he had subdued or
pacified the Barbarians of the Danube, Constantius proceeded by ssow
marches into the East3 and after he had wept over the smoking
ruins of Amida, he formed, with a powerful army, the siege of Be·-
zabde. The walls were ssmken by the reiterated efforts of the most
enormous of the battering-rams3 the town was reduced to the last
extremity3 but it was still defended by the patient and inti-epid mlour
of the garrison, till the approach of the rainy season obliged the
emperor to raise the siege, and inglorioussy to retreat into his winter-
