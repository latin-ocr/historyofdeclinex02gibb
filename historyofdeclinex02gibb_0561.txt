territories at the head of a formidable host of cuiraffiers‚ of archers, ‘s--rm—-J

and of mercenary foot3 but it was the invariable *praefice of' Sapor
to mix war and negociation‚ and to consider falsehood and perjury
as the most powerful instruments of regal policy. He affeci-ed to
praise the prudent and moderate conduc} of the king of Armenia3
and the unsuspicious Tiranus was persuaded, by the repeated zzffrrrances
· of insidious friendlhip‚ to deliver his person into the hands of a faith-
less and eruel enemy. In the midst of a splendid emm-mimnent, he
was bound in chains of filver, as an honour due to the blood of
the Arsacides 3 and, after a short confinement in the Tower of Obli-
vion at Ecbatana, he was released from the miseries of lise, either
by his own daggcr, ⁵or by that of an affaffi'n. The kingdom of Ar—
'menia was reduced to the state of a Perfian province3 the admini-
stration was lhared between a distinguished satrap andra favourite
eunuch3 and Sapor marched, without delay, to subdue the martial
spirit of the Iberianeu Sauromaces, who reigned in that country by
the permiffion of the emperors, was expelled by a superior force3
and, as—an insult on the majesty of Rome, the King of kings placed
a diadem on the head of his abjec't vafl'al Aspacuras. The city of
Artogerass'a ¹³⁴ was the only place of Armenia, which presumed to
resist the effort of his arms. The treasure deposited in that strong
fortress tempted the avarice of Sapor5 but the danger of Olympias,

compassion, and animated the desperate valour of ¹her subjeffs and
