But their national pride would have been morti-

fied: by a fair confession of their former poverty: and they boldly

marked, as the sacred inheritance of their ancestors, the gold and

jewels which they had so lately stolen from their Egyptian masters.

One hundred years before the birth of Christ, a philosophical treatise, Ιιῖἒὲοῐῡ Christ

which manifestly betrays the style and sentiments of the school of

Plato, was produced by the Alexandrian Jews, and unanimoussy re·

ceived‘ as a genuine and valuable relic of the inspired Wifflom of

Solomon ¹⁶.

A similar union of the Mosaic faith, and the Grecian

philosophy, distinguishes the works ofPhilo, which were composed, for

the most part, under the reign of Augustus ¹⁷. The material soul ofthe

universe ¹⁸ might offend the piety of the Hebrews: but they applied
the charaeta· of theLOGOS to the Jehovah of Moses and the patriarchs;

and· the Son of God was introduced upon earth under a vifible, and

even human appearance, to perform those familiar offices Which seem

incompatible with the nature and attributes of the Universal Cause'9.

According to Philo, the Therapeutse studiej

Philosoph. tom. ii. p. 787.), that they gave
the preference to that of Plato.

cf Solomon was received by many ofthe fa-
thers as the work of that monarch3 and al-
though rejec‘ted by the Protestints for want
osa liebrew original, it has obtained, with
the rest of the Vulgatc, the sanction of the
council of Trent.

¹⁷ The Platonism of Philo, which was fa-
mous to a proverb, is proved beyond a doubt
by Le Clerc (Epist. Crit. viii. p.211-zzS.).
Basnage (Hist. des Juifs, l. iv. c. ς.) has
clearly ascertained, that the theological works
of Philo were composed before the death,

The

and most probably before the birth, of Christ.

Befides this material soul, Cudworth has dis-
covered (p. 562.) in Amelius, Porphyry‚
plotinus, and, as he thinks, in Plato hirn-
sels, a superior, spiritual, upercosmian foul of
the universe. Bur this double soul is explod-
ed by Brucker, Basnage, and Le Clerc, as an
idle fancy ofthe latter Platonists.
