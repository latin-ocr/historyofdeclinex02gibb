OF THE ROMAN EMPIR'E.

“obligation of affisting, on solemn festivals, at the afl'emblies of the
Christians, Julian returned, with the impatience of a lover, to burn
his free and voluntary incense on the domestic chapels of, Jupiter
and Mercury. But as every a& of diflimulation must be painful
to an ingenuousspirit, the profeffion of Christianity encreased the
averfion of Julian for a religion, which oppreffed the freedom of his
mind, and compelle‘d him to hold a conduct repugnant to the noblest
attributes of human nature, sincerity and courage.

The inclination of Julian might prefer the gods of Homer, and of He writes

-the Scipios, to the new faith, which his uncle had established in the
Roman empire ; and in which he himself had been santffified by the
sacrament of baptism. But as a philosopher, it was incumbent on
him to justify his dissent from Christianity, which was supported
by the number of its converts, by the chain of prophecy, the
splendor of miracles, and the weight of evidence. The elaborate
work ³⁰, which he composed amidst the preparations of the Persian
war, contained the substance of those arguments which he had
long revolved in his mind. Some fragments have been transcribet}
and preserved, by his adversary, the vehement Cyril of Alexandria ³¹3

¹sophistry and fanaticism. The elegance of the style, and the rank of
