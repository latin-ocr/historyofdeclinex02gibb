THE DECLINE AND FALL

Whilst Augustus affected to maintain the freedom of election, he
consented to accept the annual privilege of recommending, or rather
indeed of nominafing, a certain proportion of candidates ; and it was
his custom to sele& one of these distinguished youths, to read his

quaestor, assuming a new and more illustrious character, alone sur-

orations, which he composed in the name of the emperor¹4⁹, acquired
the force, and, at length, the form of absolute εόἱᾶὶε, he was con-
fidered as the representative of the legissative power, the oracle of

”³ The youth and inexperience of the
qumstors, who entered on that important of-
fice in their twenty-fifth year (Lips. Excurs.
ad Tacit. l. iii. D.), engaged Augustus to re-
move thern from the management of the

Claudius, they seem to have been finally dis—

they were afterwards called, rationalcs. (Hist.

(pandect, l. i. tit. 13.) that under the govern-
ment of the house of Severus, their provin-
cial administration was abolished; and in the
subsequent troubles, the annual or triennial
eleffions of quaestors must have naturally
ceased.
