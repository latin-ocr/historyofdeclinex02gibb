628 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C g( &LP' fistanee of the ecelefiastical writers, who, in the heat of religione
ὶ-ὲ-ηκ--κ Ξὶῑὲὶὶοῃ, are apt to del'pise the profane virtues of fincerity and modera-
tion. Comiciana of these diladvantages, which will continue to involve
a considerable portion of the decline and fall of the Roman empire, I
ssiall proceed with doubtful and timorous steps. Yet I may boldly
pronouncc, that the battle of Hadrianople was never revenged by
any signal or decilive victory of Theodofius over the Barbarians; and
the expx-efiive lllCssCe of his venal orators may be confirmed by the
‹·›bl'ei·vation of the condition and circumstances of the times. The
fabric of a mighty state, which has been reared by the labours of
succeflivc ages, could not be overturned by the misfortune of a.-
smgle day, if the fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate
the real measure of the calamity. The loss of forty thou-
fund Romans, who fell in the plains of Hadrianople, might have
been soon reci-uited in the populous provinces of the East, which
contained so many millions of inhabitants. The courage of a soldier
is found to be the cheapest‚ and most common, quality of human
nature3 and sufficient skill to encounter an undisciplined foe, might
have been speedily taught by the care of the surviving centurions.
If the Barbarians were mounted on the horses, and equipped with
the armour, of their vanquissied enemies, the numerous studs of
Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons ofica-
valry3 the thirty—four arsenals of the empire were plentisully stored’
with magazines of offenfive and defenssve arms; and the wealth of
Asia might still have yielded an ample fund for the expences of the
war. But the effths which were produced by the battle of Ha-
drianopl'e on the minds of the Barbarians, and of the Romans, ex-
tended the victory of the former, and the defeat of the latter, far-
beyond the limits of a single day. A Gothic chief was heard to dc·-
