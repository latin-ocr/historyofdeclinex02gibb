extorted from him by prudence and neceffity, were the voluntary

of the people3 who loudly censured these shameful and dangerous
concessions ¹³¹. The calamities of the war were painted in the most
lively colours3 and the first symptoms of the return of order, of

to judge; and he was sufficiently removed
