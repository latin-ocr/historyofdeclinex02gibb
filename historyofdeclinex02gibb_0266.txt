THE DECLINE AND FALL

ΙΙ. The devotion of individuale, was the first circumstance which
distinguished the Christians from the Platonists: the second was the
authority os the ehurch. The disciples of philosophy asserted the
rights of intelledhlal freedom, and their respect for the sentiments of
their teachers was a liberal and voluntary tribute, which they offered
to superior reason. But the Christians formed a numerous and disei-‘
plined society3 and the jurisdirstion of their laws and magistrates was
strictly exerciscd over the minds of the faithful. The loose wander—
ings of the imagination were gradually confined by creeds and con-
feffions 40; the freedom of private judgment submitted to the public
wisdom of synods; the authority of a theologiam was determincd by
his ecclesiastica} rank3 and the episcopal succeffors of the apoflles
infliffled the censures of the church on those who deviated from the
orthodox belief. But in an age of religious controversy, every a&
of oppreflion adds new force to the elastic vigour of the mind3 and
the zeal or obstinacy os a spiritual rebel was sometimes stimulated by
secret motives of ambition or avarice. A inetaphyfical argument
became the cause or pretence of political contests; the subtleties of
the Platonis: school were used as the badges of popular faetions, and
the distance which separated their respect-ive tenets was enlarged or
magnified by the acrimony of dispute. As long as the dark here-
fies of Praxeas and Sabellius laboured to confound the Falher with
the Son 4¹, the orthodox party might be excused if they adhered more
strictly and more earnestly to the dgssinffliom than to the equali& of
the divine persons. But as soon as the heat of controversy had sub-
