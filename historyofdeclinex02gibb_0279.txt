from an orthodox source, they preserved with steadiness the doctrine ι--ψ-ι

which they h-ad accepted withdocility3 and when the Arian pestilence
approached their frondem, they were supplied with the seasonable
preservative of the Homooufion, by the paternal care of the Roman

memorable synod of Rimini‚ which stu-passed in numbers the council Α, D, 3⁶0*

of Nice, fince it wassv composed of above four hundred bishops of
Italy, Africa, Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Illyricum. From the first
debates it appeared, that only fourscore prelates adhered to the party,

trained under th‘e Eusebian banner, in the religious wars of the

Latin provinces had no sooner reached their respective dioceses,
than they discovered their mistake‚ and repented of their weakness.
The ignominious capitulation was rejected with disdain and abhor-
rence: and the Homooufian standard, which had been ssiaken but
