their western conquests to the banks of the Danube, and the limits μὴτ-4

of European Scythia. The eastern provinces of their empire were
exposed to the Scythians of Afia 3 the wild inhabitants of the plains
beyond the Oxus and the Jaxartes‚ two mighty rivers, which dire&

their course towards the Caspian sea. The long and memorable

quarrel of Iran and Touran, is still the theme of history or romance :⁷

the famous, perhaps the fabulous, valour of the Pei-fian heroes,

try against the Afrafiabs of the North ²⁰3 and the invincible spirit of
the same Barbarians 1·efisted, on the same ground, the victorious
arms of Cyrus and Alexander ²¹. In the eyes of the Greeks and
Persians, the real geography of Scythia was bounded, on the East,
hythe mountains of Imaus, or Caf; and their distant prospe& of
the extreme and inacceffible parts of Afia was clouded by ignorance,
or perplexed by fieiion. But those inaccessible regions are the ancient
refidence of a powerful and civilised nation ²², which ascends, by a

probable tradition, above forty centuries²³

²0 These wars and heroes may be found,
under their respeffive titles, in the Biblio-
theque Orientale of d’Herbelot. They have
been celebrated in an epic poem of sixty thou-
sandrhymed couplets, by Ferdufi, the Homer
of Perfia. See the History of Nader Shah,
p. 145· 165. The public must lamera, tha

tal learning.

adjacent tribes, are laborioussy illustrated in
the Examen Critique des Historiens d'Alex

rauce of the Greeks.

²² The original seat ofthe nation appears to ¹

have been in theNorth-west ofC-hina,in the pro-
vinces ofChenfi and Chanfi. Under the two first
dynasties, the principal town was stilla move-
able camp; the villages were thinly scattered;
more land was employed in pasture than in
tillage ; the exercise ofhunting was ordained
to clear the country from wild beasts3 Petcheli
(where Pekin stands) was a desert ; and the
southern provinces were peopled with Indian
savages. γ The dynasty of the Han (before
Christ 206.) gave the empire its actual form
and extent.
