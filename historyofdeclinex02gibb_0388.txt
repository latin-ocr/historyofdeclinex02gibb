which condescended to fear thern3 and if the pagans were relustantly
indulged in the exercise of their superstition, the rank of Julian÷ ”
would have excepted him from the general toleration. The apostate-
soon became 'the presumptive heir of the monarchy, and his death
could alone have appeased the just apprehensions of the Christians ²⁸.
But the young prince, who aspired to the glory of 3 11610 rather
than of a martyr, consulted his safety by diffembling his religion3
and the easy temper of polytheism permitted him to join in the
public worship of a sect which he inwardly despised. Libanius
has confidered the hypocrisy of his friend as a subject, not of
censure, but of praise. “ As the 11311163 of the gods,” says 1111ιὲ013-

years, from his secret initiation at Ephesus, to the beginning of the
civil war, when he declared himself 31 01166 1116 implacable enemy
of Christ and of Constantius. This 11316 of constraint might con-
