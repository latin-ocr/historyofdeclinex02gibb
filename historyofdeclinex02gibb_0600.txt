the condition of a temporary and precarious peace ; and the wretched
expedient of disguifing a real tribute, under the names of a gift or a
subsidy, was praetised hythe emperors of Chim, as well as by those of
Rome. But there still remained a more disgraceful article of tribute3
which violated the sacred feelings of humanity and nature. The
hardships of the savage life, which desti-oy in their infancy the

those of the Moguls, or of the Mantcheoux ;μ and their ambitiosi
