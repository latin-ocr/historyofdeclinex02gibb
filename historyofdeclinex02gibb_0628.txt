the Huns and the Alani, delayed the conquests, and distracted
the councils, of that vietorious people. Several of the hords were
allured by the liberal promises of Fritigern; and the rapid cavalry
of Scythia, added weight and energy to the steady and strenuous
efforts of the Gothic infantry. The Sarmatiam, who could never
forgive the succeffor of Valenffiniaxx, enjoyed and encreased the gene-

the West, to the afflstassee of his uncle Valens, pointed out to the
rcstless spirit of the Alemanni, the moment, and the mode, of a
successful invasion. The enterprise of some light detachments‚ who,
in the month of February, paffed the Rhine upon the iee, was the
preinde of a more important war. The boldest hopes of rapine,
perhaps of conquest, outweighed the considerations of timid pru-
dence, or national saith. Iivery forest, and every village, poured
