of his country and of human kind. In that of Constantine, we ι--φ--θ

may contemplate a hero, who had so long inspired his subjeffits with
love, and his enemies with terror, degenerating into a cruel and dis-
solute monamh, corrupted by his fortune, or raised by conquest
above the neceffity of diflimulation. The general peace which he
maintained during the last fourteen years of his reign, was a period
of apparent splendor rather than of real prosperity ; and the old age-
of Constantine was disgraced by the opposite yet reconcileable vices
of rapaciousncss and prodigality. The accumulated treasures found
in the palaces of Maxentius and Licinius, were lavissily consumed ς.
‘the various innovatione> introduced by the conqueror, were attended
with an encreasmg expence 3 the eost of his buildings, his court, and*
his festivals, required an immediate and plentiful supply3 and the
oppreflion of the people was the only fund which could support
the magnificence of the fover-eignfi His unworthy favour-ites, en-
riched by the boundless liberality of their master, usurped with
impunity the privilege of rapine and corruption ⁵. A secret but
universal decay was felt in every part of the public administration,
and the emperor himself, though he still retained the obedience,
gradually lost the esteem‚ of his subjeos. The dress and manner&
which, towards the decline of life, he chose to affeeh served only to
degrade him in the eyes of mankind. The Afiatie pomp, which
had been adopted by the pride of Diocleum, affumed an air of
sbftness a-nd effeminacy in the person of Constantine.
