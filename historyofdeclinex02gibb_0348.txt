THE DECLINE AND FALL

faithful minister, alone and unaflisted, asserted the rights of Constan-
tius in the midst of an armed and angry multitude, to whose fury he
had almost fallen an honourable, but useless, sacrifice. After losing
one of his hands by the stroke of a sword, he embraced the knees of
the prince whom he had offended. Julian covered the praese& with
his Imperial mantle, and protecting him from the καὶ] of his follow-
ers, dismissed him to his own house, with less respee‘t than was pcr-
haps due to the virtue of an enemy ²⁶. The high office of Nebridius
was bestowed on Sallust; and the provinces of Gaul, which were
now delivered from the intolerable oppreflion of taxes, enjoyed the
mild and equitable administration of the friend of Julian, who was
permitted to praetise those virtues which he had instilled into the mind
of his pupil ²⁷.

The hopes of Julian depended much less on the number of his
troops, than on the celerity of his motions. In the execution of a
dai-ing enter-prise, he availed himself of every precaution, as far as
prudence could suggest ; and where prudence could no longer accom-
pany his steps, he trusted the event to valour and to fortune. In the
neighbourhood of Bafil he affembled and divided his army ²³. One
body, which consisted of ten thousand men, was directed, under
ihc command of Nevitta, general of the cavalry, to advance through
the midland parts of Rhaetia and Noricum. A similar division of
troops, under the orders of Jovius and Jovinus, prepared to fol-
