THE DECLINE AND FALL

themselves, from different motives of a temporal or a spiritual na-
-ture, were seldom impatient to assume the charaeter of perse& and
initiated Christians. The sacrament of baptism was supposed to -con-
‘cain a full and absolute expiation of s1n; and the soul was instantly
restored to its original purity, and entitled to the promise of eternal
salvation. Among the proselytes of Christianity, kherebwere many
who judged it imprudent to precipitate a salutary rife, >³which could
not be repeated3 to throw away an inestimabl& privilege, which
could never be recovered. By the delay of their baptism, they could
venture freely to indulge their passions in the enjoyment of this
world, while they still retained in their own hands the means of a

above the imperfe& heroism and profane philosophy of Trajan and

I believe that this delay of baptism, though
attended with the most pernicious conse-

neral or provincial council, or by any public
a& or declaration of the church. The zeal
of the bishops was easily kindled on much
ssighter occasions.
