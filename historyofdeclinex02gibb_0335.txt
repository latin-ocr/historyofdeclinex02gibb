‘oF THE ROMAN EMPIR‘E.

dud ‘t'hat of a people who deserved his affection. But a positive re-
fusal was an a& of rebellion, and a declaration of war. The in-
exorable jealousy of the emperor, the pelemptory, and perhaps
instdious,z nature of his commands, left not any room for a fair
'apology‚ or candid interpretation3 and the dependent station os the
Caesar scarcely 'allowed him to pause or to deliberate. Solitude
encreased the perplexity of Julian; he could no longer apply to the
faithful counsels of Sallust, who had been removed from his office
by the judicious malice of the eunuchs: he could not even enforce
his representations by the concurrence of the ministers, who would
have been afraid, or assiamed, to approve the ruin of Gaul. The
moment had been chosen, when Lupicinus ⁵, the general of the
cavalry, was dispatched into Britain, to repulse the inroads of the
Scots and Piens 3 and Florentius was occupied at Vienna by the as-

seffinent of the tribute. The latter, a crafty and corrupt statesman,
declining to affume a responsible part on this dangerous occasion,
eluded the preffing and repeated invitations of Julian, who repre-
sented to him, that in every important measure, the presence of the
praefe& was indispensable in the council of the prince. In the
mean while the Caesar was oppreffed by the rude and importunate
solicitations of the Imperial meffengers, who presumed to suggest,
that if he expected the return of his ministers‚ he would charge
himself with the guilt of the delny, and reserve for rhein the merit
of the execution. Umble to resist, unwilling to comply, Julian ex·-
preffed‚ in the most serious terme, his wilh, and eren his intention,
of resigning the purple, which he could not 'preserve with honour,
but which he could not abdicate with safety.
