OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The foundation of a new capital is naturally connched vvith the
establilhment of a new form of civil and military administration-
The distin& view of the complicated system of policy, introduced
by Diocletian, improved by Constantine, and completed by his
immediate succeffors, may not only amuse the fancy by the singular
picture of a great empire, but will tend to illustrate the secret and
internal causes of its rapid decay. In the pursuit of any remarkable
institution, We may be frequently led into the more early 01· the more
recent times of the Roman history; but the proper limits of this
enquiry will be included within a period of about one hundred and
thirty years, from the accession of Constantine to the publication of
the Theodosian code 7“; from which, as well as from the Notitia of
the east and west72, we derive the most copious and authentic in-
formation of the state of the emp-ire. This variety of objects will
suspend, for some time, the course of the narrative3 but the inter-
ruption will be censured only by those readers who are insensible to
the importance of laws and manners, while they pei-use, with eager
curiosity, the transient intrigues of a court, or the accidental event
of a battle.

The manly pride of the Romans, content with substantial power,

had left to the vanity of the east the forms and ceremonies of osten-

human ambition, and seems to triumph in
tlie disappointment of Constantine, whose
immortal name is now lost in the vulgar ap-
pellation of Jstambol‚ a anlcish corrup-
tion of εις Yet the original name
is still preserved, 1. By tlie nations cf Eu·
rope. 2. By the modern Greeks. 3. By
the Arabs, whose writings are diffused over
the wide extent of their conqnests in Asia
and Africa. See d’Herbelot Bibliotheque
Orientale, p. 275. 4. By the more learned
Turks‚ and by the emperor himself in his
public mandates. Cantemir’s History of the
othman Empire, p. 5¹·

⁷¹ The Theodofian code was promulgated
A. D. 438. See the Prolegomena of Gode-
froy, c. i. p. 185.

⁷² Pancirolus, in his elaborate Commen-
tary, affigns to the Notitia a date almost
similar to that os the Theodosian code ; but
his proofs, or rather conjeStures, are ex-
tremely feeble. Ι should be rather inclined
to place this useful work between the final
division of the empire (A. D. 395), and the
successful invasion of Gaul by the Barbarians
(A. D. 407). See Histoire des ariciens Peu-
ples de l’Europe, tom. vii. p. 40.
