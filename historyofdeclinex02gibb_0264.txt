THE DECLINE AND FALL

Logos had been revealed as the sacred object of the saith, the hope,

u-ffffl and the religious worship of the Christians3 the mysterious system-

was embraced by a numerous and increafing multitude in every pro-
vince of the Roman world. Those persons who, from their age, or
seX, or occupations, were the least qualified to judge, who were the
least exercised in the habits of abstra& reasoning3 aspired to contem·-
plate the oeconomy of the Divine Nature: and it is the boast of
Tertullianu, that a Christian mechanic could readily answcr such
questions as had perplexed the wisest of the Grecian suges. &Vliere
the subje& lies so far beyond our reach, the difference between the
highest and the lowest of human understandings may indeed be cal-
culated as infinitely small; yet the degree of weakness may perhaps
be measured by the degree of obstinacy and dogmatic confidence.>
These speculations, instead of being treated as the amusement of a
vacant bour, became the most serious busmess of the present, and the
most useful preparation for a future, life. A theology, which it was
incumbent to believe, which it was impious to doubt, and which it
might be dangerous, and even fatal, to mistake, became the familiar
'topic of private meditation and popular discourse. The cold indif—
ference of philosophy was inflamed by the fervent spirit of devotion;
and even the metaphors of common language suggested the fallacious
prejudices of sense and experience. The Christians, who abhor-
red the gross and impure generation of the Greek mythology ³⁵,
were tempted to argue from the familiar analogy of the filial and
paternal relations. The character of Son seemed to imply a perpe·

that though he had transsated the Timaeus, ³⁵ Lamnum, iv. 8. Yet the I’wbsk, m-
he could never understand· that mysterious Prolatio, which the most orthodox dii-ines
dialogue. See Hieronym. praef. ad l. xii. in bon-owed without scruple from the Valenti-
isaiam, tom. v. p. ¹54· nians, and illustrate-d by the comparisons of

³⁴ Tertuffian. in Apolog. c. 46. See a fouiitain and stream, the sun and its rays,
fflyle, Dic‘lionnaire, au mot Simonide. His Sec. either meant nothing, or favoni-ed a
remarks on the presumption of Tertullian material idea of the divine generation. Sec
ave profound and interesting. Beausobre, tom. i. 1. iii. c. 7. p. 548.
