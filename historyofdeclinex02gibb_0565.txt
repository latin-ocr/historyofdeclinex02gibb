was in arms, and to trust his independence and safety to the disere· h-v-——J

’ tion of a perfidious court. The king of Armenia, for such hc ap—
peared in his own eyes, and in those of his nafion, was received with
due honours by the governor& of the provinces through which he
pass'ed3 but when he arrived at Tarsus in Cilicia, his progress was
stopped under various pretences; his moti0ns were watched with
respedfful vigilance3 and he gradually discovered, that he was a pri-

diffembled his fears, and, after secretly preparing his escape, mounted
on horsebaek‘with three hundred of his faithful followers. The
cfficer stationed at the door of his apartment immediately com-

to pursue the royal fugitive5 but the pursuit of infantry could
not be very alarming to a body of light cavalry3 and upon the
first cloud of arrows that was discharged into the air, they re-

been occupied by a thousand archers on horseback, under the com-
mand of a count and a tribune. Para must have yielded to superior
force, if the accideutzil arrival rof a friendly traveller had not revealed
the danger, and the means of escape. A dark and almost impervious
path securely conveyed the Armenian troop through the thie-ket ; and
Para had left behind him the count and the tribune, while they pa-
tientl'y expetited his approach along the public highways. They re—
