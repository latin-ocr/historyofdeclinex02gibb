x-ae—v--ae breed of boi-ses, which are easily trained for the purposes of war and

hunting. The Scythians of every age have been celebrated as bold
and skilful riders: and constant practice had seated them so firmly
on horseback, that they were supposed by strangers to perform the
ordinary duties of civil life, to eat, to drink, and even to sseep,
without (lismounting from their steeds. They excel in the dex-
terous management of the lance3 the long Tartar bow is drawn
with a nervous arm3 and the weighty arrow is directed to its ob-
je& with uncti-ing aim, and irresistible force. These arrows are often
pointed against the harmless animals of the desert, which increase
and multiply in the absence of their most formidable enemy3 the
hare, the goat, the roebuck‚ the fallow-deer‚ the stag, the elk‚ and
the antelope. The vigour and patience both of the men and horses
are continually exercised by the fatigues of the chace3 and the plen-
tiful supply of game contributes to the subfistence‚ and even luxury,
of a Tartar camp. But the exploits of the hunters of Scythia are
not confined to the destruction of timid or innoxious beasts; they
boldly encounter the angry wild-boar‚ when he turns against his
pursuers, excite the ssuggish courage of the bear, and provoke the
fui-y of the tyger, as he ssumbers in the thicket. XVhere there is
danger there may be glory: and the mode of hundug, which opens
the fairest field to the exertions of valour, may justly be considered
as the image, and as the school, of war. The general hunting-
matches, the· pride and delight of the Tartar princes, compose
an instructive exercise for their numerous cavalry. A circle is
drawn, of many miles in circumference‚ to encompass the game
of an extensive dist1·i&; and the troops that form the circle re-
gularly advance towards a common centre3 where the captive
animals, surrounded on every fide, are abandoned to the dai-ts of the
hunters. In this march, which frequently continues many days, the
