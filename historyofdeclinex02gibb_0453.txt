to have been condu&ed by the hands of strangers. Babylon had
been converted into a roynl park3 but near the ruins of the ancient
capital, new cities had lixccefi'ively aristen, and the populousness of
the country was displayed in the multitude of towns and villages‚
which were built of bricks, dried in the sun, and strongly cemented
