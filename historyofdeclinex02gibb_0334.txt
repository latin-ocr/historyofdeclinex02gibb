THE DECLINE AND FALL

t-v—-av of the auxiliaries, who engaged their voluntary service, had stipu-

lated, that they should ncvcr be obliged to pass the Alps. The
public faith of- Rome, and the personal honour of Julian, had been,
pledgcd for the ,observance of this condition. Such an a& of trea-
chery and oppression would destroy the confidencc, and excite the
resentment, of the independent warriors of Germauy, who confi-
dei-ed truth as the noblest of their virtues, and freedom as the most

valuable of their poffeflions. The legionaries, who enjoyed the
title and privileges of Romans, were enlisted for the general defence-

of ’ the republic 3> but those mercenary troops heard with cold indif-
ference the antiquated names of the republic and of Rome. At-
tached, either from birth or long habit, to the climate and manners
of Gaul, they loved and admired Julian3 they despised, and per--
haps hated, the emperor ; they dreaded the laborious march, the
Perfian arrows, and the burning deserts of Afia. They claimed, as
their own, the country which they had saved3 and excused their
want of spirit, by pleading the sacred and more immediate duty of ’
proteCdng their families and friends. The apprehensione, of the-⁴
Gauls were derived from the knowledge of the impending and in-·
evitable danger. As soon as the provinces were exhausted of their·
military strength, the Germaus would violate a treaty which had·
been imposed on their fears3 and notwithstanding the abilities and
valour of Julian, the general of a> nomina] army, to whom the*

public calamities would be imputed, must find himself, after a vain
resistance, either¹ a prisoner in the camp of the Barbarians, or a

criminal in the palace of Constantius. If Julian complied with the·
orders which he had received, he subscribed his own destruffion,

three thousand miles, would render the or- have reached Syria till the end of autumn,
ders of Constantius as extravagant as they The memory of Ammianus must have been

were unjust. The troops of Gaul could not inaccurate‚ and his language incoriec't.
