THE DECLINE AND FALL

the salutary {ign of the Christian religion. The secret vision of
Constantine could be disproved only by the event ; and the intrepid
hero who had paffed the Alps and the Apennine, might view with

careless despair the consequences of a defeat under the walls of
Rome. The senate and people, exulting in their own deliverance
from an odious tyrant, aeknowledged that the viCtory of Constan-

it had been obtained by the prote6fion of the Gods. The triumpha]
arch, which was erected about three years after the event, pro-
claims, in ambiguous language, that, by the greatness of his own
mind, and by an ilfiinfi or impulse of the Divinity, he had saved
and avenged the Roman republic ⁴³. The Pagan orator, who had
seized an earlier opportunity of celebrating the virtues of the con-
queror, supposes that he alone enjoyed a secret and intimate com-
merce with the Supreme Being, who delegated the care of mortals
to his subordinate deities; and thus affigns a very plausible reason
why the subjeets of Constantine should not presume to embrace the
new religion of their sovereign ⁴⁴.

of ecclesiastical history, will probably conclude, that if the eyes of
the speetators have sometimes been deceived by fraud, the under-
standing of the readers has much more frequently been insulted
‘by fiffifion. Every event, or appearance, or accident, which seems
to deviate from the ordinary course of nature, has been ralhly
ascribed to the immediate adlion of the Deity; and the astonish-

ed fancy of the multitude has sometimes given ssiape and colom,
