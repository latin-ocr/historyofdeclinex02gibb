that they were the workmanship, not of an inferior deity, but of the
Omnipotent King. In the system of the Platonists, the vifible, was
a type of the invislble, world. The celestial bodies, as they were

infor-med by a divine spirit, might be considered as the objects the
most worthy of religious worship. The SU N, whose genial influence

pervades and sustains the universe, justly claimed the adoration of
mankind, as the bright representative of the LOGOS, the lively, the
rational, the beneficcnt image of the intellestual Father ²¹.

In every age, the absence of genuine inspiration is supplied by the
strong illusions of enthusiasm, and the inimic arts of imposture. If,
in the time of Julian, these arts had been praCtised only by the pa-
gan priests, for the support of an expiring cause, some indulgence
might perhaps be allowed to the interest and habits of the sacerdotal
character. But it may appear a subject of surprise and scandal‚ that
the philosophers themselves should have contributed to abuse the
superstitious credulity of mankind ²², and that the Grecian mysteries
should have been supported by the magic or theurgy of the modern
Platonists. They arrogantly pretended to controul the order of na-
ture, to explore the secrets of futurity, to command the sewice of
the inferior daemons, to enjoy the view and conversation of the su-
perior gods, and, by disengaging the soul from her material bands,
to reunite that immortal particle with ,the Infinite and Divine
Spirit.
