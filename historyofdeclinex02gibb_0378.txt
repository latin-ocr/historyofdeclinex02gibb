two princes advanced towards the years of manhood, they disco-

the Gospe13 and his a&ive curiosity might have been gratificd by a

theological system, which explains the mysterious essence of the
Deity3 and opens the boundless prospe& of invisible and future “
worlds. But the independent spirit of Julian refused to yield the
passive and unrefisting obedience which was required, in the name
of religion, hythe haughty ministers of the church. Their specu-

terrors of eternal punishinent53 but while they prescribed the rigid
formulary of the thoughts, the words, and the aetions of the young
prince; whilst they silenced his objections, and severely checked the
freedom of his enquiries, they secretly provoked his impatient genius
