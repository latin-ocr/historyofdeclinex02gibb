OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

309

The divisions of Christianity suspended the ruin of pagang'fhl ¹⁶⁸ ; C H A P.

and the holy war against the infidele was less vigoroully prosecuted

by princes and. bishops, who were more immediately alarmed by

the guilt and danger of domestic rebellion.
idolatry ¹⁶⁹ might have been justified by the established principles of

intolerance: but the hostile seets, which alternately* reigned in the

tom. xv. p. 75—144.)‚ is a very learned and

judicious performancre, which explains the
state, and proves the toleration, of paganism

from Constantine to Gratian. The affertion
of Zosimus, that Gratian was the first who
refused the pontifical robe, is confirmed be·
yond a doubt: and the murmurs of bigony,
on that subjeci, are almost filenced.

¹⁶⁸ As Ι have freely anticipated the use of
pag-ans and paganism, I. shall now trace the
singular revolutions osthose celebrated words.
1. Πωγγ, in the Doric dialeft, so familiar to
the Italians, fignifiesa fountain ; and the rural
neighbourhood which frequented the same
fountain, derived the common appellation of
pagus and pagam (Festus sub voce, and Servius
:td Virgil. Georgic. ii. 382.). z. By an easy
extensron of the wordjjvagan and rural be-
came almost synonimcus (Plin. Hist. Natur.
xxviii. ς.) ; and the meaner rustics :required
that name, which has been corrupted into
pse-Avus in the modern languages of Europer
3. The anmzing increase os the military
order introduced the necessity of a correlative
term (Hume's Effays, vol. i. p. 555.) ; and
all the people who were not enlisted in the
service of the prince were branded with the
contemptuous epithet of pagens (Tacit. Hist.
iii. 24- 43. 77. Juvenal. Satis. xvi. Tertullian
de Pallio, c. 4.). 4. The Christians were
the soldiers of christ; their adversaries, who
Α refused hisſszcrammzt, or military oath of bap-
tism, might deserve the metaphorical name
of pagans3 and this popular reproach was
introduced as early as the reign of Valenti-
nian ⁴A. D. 365.) into Imperial laws (Cod.
Theodos. l. xvi. tit. ii. leg. 18.) and theo-
logicavaritings. 5. Christianity gradually

filled the citics of the empire: the old reli>
gion, in the time os Prudentius (advers.
Symmachum, l. i. ad fin.) and Orosius (in
Praefat. Hist‘.)‚ retired ancl languished in ob-
scure villages; :md the word pagam, with its
new signification, reverted to its primitive
origin. 6. Since the worship of Jupiter and
his family has expired‚ the vacant title of pa-
gans has been succeffively applied to all the
idolaters and polytheists of the old and new
world. 7. The Latin Christians bestowed it,
without scruple, on their mortal enemies the
Mahometans; and the purest tmitarians were
branded with the unjust reproach of idolatry
and paganism. See Gcrnrd Vossius Etymo-
Iogicon Linguae Latinae, in his works, tom. i.
p. 420. Godefroy's Commentary on the Theo-
dofian Code, torn. vi. p. ²50· and Ducange,
mediae ἃ infima: Latinitat. Gloss'ar.

¹⁶⁹ In the pure language of Ionia and
Athens, Ειδωλον and Aca-5⁵12 were ancient and
familiar wor ’5. The former expresi'ed a
likeness, an apparition (Homer. Odyff. xi.
601.), a representation, an¹ image, created
either by fancy or art. The latter denoted
any sort offir—visc or flavet-y. The Jews of
Egypt, who transsated the Hebrew scripture5‚
restrained the use of these words (Exod. xx. 4,
ς.) to the religious worship ofan image. The
peculiar idiom of the Hellenists, or Greciun
Jews, has been adopted by the sacred and
ecclefiastical writers; and the rcproach of
idolam-y (edmomssffia) hasstig1natizet1that vi-
s1ble and abjet‘t mode of superstition, which
some sefts of Christianity ssiould not hastily
impute to the polytheists of Grcece aud
Rome.
