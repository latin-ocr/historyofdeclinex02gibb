THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H Α P· the East without a sovereign3 and Julius, who filled the important

b--v--J station of master-general of the troops, with a high reputation of di-

ligence and ability‚ thought it his duty to consult the senate of Con-
stantinople ς which he considered, during the vacancy of the throne,
as the representative council of the nation. As soon as he had ob·
tained the discretionary power of affing as he should judge most
expedient for the good of the republic, he affembled the principal
Officers ; and privately concerted effeetual measures for the execution
of his bloody defigo, An order was immediately promulgated‚ thar,
on a stated day, the Gothic youth should affemble in the capital cities
of their respective provinces; and, as a report was industrioussy
circulated, that they were summoned to receive a liberal gift of lands
and money, the pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment,
and perhaps suspended the motions of the conspiracy. On the ap-
pointed day, the unarmed crowd of the Gothic youth was carefully

collected in the square, or Forum: the streets and avenues were oc·-
cupied by the Roman troops3 and the roofs of the houses were
covered with archers and llingem. At the same hour, in all the
cities of the East, the signal was given of indiscriminate ssaughter3
and the provinces of Asia were delivered, by the cruel prudence of
Julius, from a domestic enemy, who, in a few months, might have
carried sire and sword from the Hellespont to the Euphrates ¹⁰³. The
urgent consideration of the public safety may undoubtedly authorise
the violation of every positive law. How far, that, or any other, con-
sideration, may operate, to dissolve the natural obligations of huma-
nity and justice, is a doctrine, of which I still defire to remain

ignorant.
