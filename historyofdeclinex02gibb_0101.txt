This dangerous popularity soon excited the attention of Constan- jealousy of

tine, who, both as a father and as a king, was impatient of an (lienDanZtXie

equal. Instead of attempting to secure the allegiance of his son, by onober ¹⁰⁹
the generous ties of confidence and gratitude, he resolved to prevent
the mischie‘fs which might be apprehended from diffatissied ambition.
Crispus soon had reason to complain, that while his infant brother
Constantius was sent, with the title of Caesar, to reign over his pe·-
culiar department of the Gallie provinces¹¹, he, a prince of mature
years, who had performed such recent and signal services, instead of

being raised to the superior rank of Augustus, was confined almost
a prisoner to his father's court3 and exposed, without power or de-

suspicions, that a secret conspiracy had been formed against his per-

magistrates or ministers, his friends or his most intimate favourites,
