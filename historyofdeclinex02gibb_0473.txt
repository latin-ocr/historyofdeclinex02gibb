oF THE ROMAN EMP1RE}

, As long as the Romans seemed to advance into the country, their
march was observed and insulted from a distance, by several bodies
of Persian cavalry; who ssiewing themselves, sometimes in loose, and
sometimes in closer, order, faintly sszirmished with the advanced
guards. These detachments were, however, supported by a much·
greater foree3 and the heads of the columns were no sooner pointedv
towards the Tigris, than a cloud· of dust arose on the plain. The>
Romans, who now aspired only to thepermiffion of a safe and¹
speedy retreat, endeavoured to persuade themselves, that this formi-
dable appearance was occasioned by a troop of wild afl'es, or perhaps
by the. approach of some friendly Arabs. They hahed, pitched
their tents, fortified their camp, pass'ed the whole night in continual
alarms; andxdiscovered, at the dawn of day, that they were sur-

rounded by anv army of Perfians. This army, which might be

confidered only'as the van of the Barbarians, was soon followed by*
the main body of cuiraffiers, archers, and elephants, commanded by*

hieranesr a general of rank and reputation. He was accompanied‘

by two· of the king's sons, and many of the principal satraps ; and,

fame and expeffibation exaggerated the strength of the remaining
powers, which ssowly advanced under the conduct of Sapor himself.
As the Romans continued their march, their long array, which was
forced to bend or divide, according to the varieties of the ground, af-
forded frequent and savourable opportunities to their vigilant enemies.
The Persians repeatedly charged with fury3 they were repeatedly re-
pulsed with firmncss3 and the adlini] at Niaronga,which almost deserved
the name of a battle, was marked by a considerable loss of satraps and

elephants‚ perhaps of equal value in the eyes of their monarch.

These splendid advantages were not obtained without an adequate«
