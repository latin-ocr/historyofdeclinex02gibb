OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

policy of Valentinian was continually employed in adding new for-
tifications to the security of the frontier: but the abuse of this policy
provoked the just refentment of the Barbarians. The Qadi com-

of two Imperial generals was stained with the royal blood of two
guests and allies, inhumanly murdered by their order, and in their
presence. The fate of Gabinius, and of Para, was the same: but
the cruel death of their sovereign was resented in a very dif-
