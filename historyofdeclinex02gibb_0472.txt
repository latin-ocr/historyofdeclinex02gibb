arbitrary government, which consults the public safety without sub-
mitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice. On the present
occasion, the zeal and obedience of the Perfians seconded the com-
mands of Sapor3 and the emperor was soon reduced to the scanty
stock of provisions, which continually wasted in his hands. Before
they were entirely consumed, he might still have reached the wealthy
and unwarlike cities of Ecbatana, or Susa, by the effort of a rapid
and well—directed march ‘³⁶3 but he was deprived of this last resource
by his ignorance of the roads, and by the perfidy of his guides.
The Romans wandered several days in the country to the eastward of
Bagdad: the Perfian deferrer, who had artfully led them into the
snare, escaped from their resentment; and his followers, as soon as
they were put to the tortum, confessed the secret of the conspiracy.
The vifionary conquests of Hyrcania and India, which had so long
amused, now tormented‚ the mind of Julian. Conscious that
his own imprudence was the cause of the public distress, he
anxioussy balanced the hopes of safety or succesS, without obtaining
a satisfactory answer either from gods or men, At length, as the:
only praeticable measure, he embraced the resolution of directing hit)
steps towards the banks of the TigriS, with the defign of saving the:
army by a hasty march to the confines of Corduene3 a fertile and.»
friendly province,which acknovvledged the sovereignty of Rome. The
desponding troops -obeyed the figual of the retreat, only seventy·
days after they had paffed the Chaboras, with the sanguine expecta-

tion of subverting the throne of Perfia ⁸⁷.
