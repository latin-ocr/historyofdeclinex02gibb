man and eunuch of Claudius, in whose fa-
vour the emperor prostituted some of the most
honourable rewards of military valour. See
Sueten. in Claudio, c. 28. Posides employed
a great part of his wealth in building.

⁶ There is a passage in the Augustan history,
p. 137, in which Lampridius, whilst he
praises Alexander Severus and Constantine
for restraining the tyranny of the eunuchs,
deplores the mischiefs which they occasioned
in other reigns. Huc acceditquod eunuchos
nec in consiliis nec in ministeriis habuit; qui
soli principes perdunt, dum eos more gentium
aut regum Persarum volunt vivere ; qui a po-
pulo etiam amicissimum semovent; qui inter-
nuntii sunt, aliud quam respondetur referen-

⁷ Xenophon (Cyropoedia, l. viii. p. 540.)
has stated the specious reasons which engaged
Cyrus to entrust his person to the guard of
eunuchs. He had observed in animals,.that
although the practice of castration might tarne
their ungovernable fierceness, it did not di-
minish their strength or spirit; and he per-
suaded himself, that those who were separated
from the rest of human kind, would be more
firmly attached to the person of their bene-
sanor. But a long experience has contra-
diaed the judgment of Cyrus. Some parti-
cular instances may occur of eunuchs distin-
guistred by their fidelity‚ their valour, and
their abilities ; but if we examine the gene-
ral history of Persia, India, and China, we
shall find that the power of the eunuchs has
uniformly marked the decline and fall of every
dynasty.

⁸ See Ammianus Marcellinus, l. xxi. c. 16.
l. xxii. c. 4. The whole tenor of his impar-
rial history serves to justisy the ἰηνεξὶίνεε. of
Mamertinus, of Libanius, and of Julian him-
sels, who have insulted the vices of the court
ofConsxantius‘
