Reduftiou of

the legions.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

which still remained under the name of the troops of the frontier,
might be sufficient for the ordinary defence. But their spirit was
degrtided by the humiliating refiectiom that they who were exposed
to the hardships and dangers of a perpetual warfare, were rewarded
‘only with about two-thirds of the pay and emoluments which
were lavished on the troops of the court. Even the bands or
legions that were raised the nearest to the level of those unworthy
favourites, were in some measure disgraced by the title of honour
which they were allowed to assume. It was in vain that Con-
stantine repeated the most dreadful menaces of fire and sword against
the Borderers who should dare to desert their colours, to connive at
the inroads of the Barbarians, or to participate in the spoil ¹³0. The
mischiefs which fiow from injudicious counsels are seldom removed
by the application of partial severities: and though succeeding princes

laboured to restore the strength and numbers of the frontier garrisons,
the empire, till the last moment of its diffolution, continued to lan-

- guish under the mortal wound which had been so rashly or so weakly

inflieced by the hand of Constantine.

The same timid poliey, of dividing whatever is united, of re-
ducing whatever is eminent, of (heading every aetive power, and
of expefiling that the most feeble will prove the most obedient,
seems to pervade the institutione of several princes, and particularly

those of Constantine. The martial pride of the legions, whose vic- ⁷

torious camps had so often been the scene of rebellion, was nourilhed
by the memory of their past explohs, and the consciousness of their
aestua] strength. As long as they maintained their antient establish-
ment of six thousand men, they sublisted, under the reign of Diocle-
tian, each of them singly‚ a visible and important obje& in the
military history of the Roman empire. A few years afterwards,
