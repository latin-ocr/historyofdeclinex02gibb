reasons which had compelled him to subscribe the condemnation of
a criminaL or at least of a degenerate, sonu.

The innocence of Crispus was so universally acknowledged, that
the modern Greeks, who adore the memory of their founder, are
reduced to palliate the guilt of a parricide, which the common feel-
ings of human nature foi-bade them to justify. They pretend, that
as soon a's the afflicted father discovered the falsehood of the accu-

forty days, during which he abstained from the use of the bath, and
all the ordinary comforts of life 3 and that, for the lasting instruction
of posterity, he erected a golden statue of Crispus, with this me-
