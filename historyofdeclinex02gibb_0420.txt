400 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C. {agl-R The modest bchaviour which might have assuaged the jealousy of an

μον-ῳ hostile govcrnment, was neglecte-:d on this occasion by the zeal of the
Christians. The lofty car, that transported the relies of Babylas,
was followed, and accompanied, and received, by an innumerable
multitude; who chanted, with thundering acclamations, the Psalms

of DaYid the most cxpreffive of their contempt for idols and ido- ,
laters. The return of the saint was a triumph; and the triumph
was an insult on the religion of the emperor, who exertcd his pride
to diss'emble his resentment. During the night which terminated
this indiscreet procellion, the temple of Daphne was in fiames3 the x
statue of Apollo was consumed ; and the walls of the edifice virere left
a naked ‘and awful monument of ruin. The Christi-ans of Antioch
asserted, with religious confidence, that the powerful intercession of
St. Babylas had pointed ‘the lightnings of heaven against the devoted
. roof: but as Julian was reduced to the alternative, of‘belicving either
a crime or a miracle, he chose, without hesitation, without evidence,
but with some colom· of probability, to impute the fire of Daphne

to the revenge of the Galilaeans ¹¹³.
