solitude of their woods and mountains. Every tide might float down x--w-——J

the Elbe whole fleets of canoes, filled with hardy and intrepid
affociates, who aspired to behold the unbounded prospe& of the
ocean, and to taste the we—alth and luxury of unknown worlds. It
should seem probable, however, that the most numerous auxiliaries
of the Saxons were furnished hythe nations who dwelt along the
shores of the Baltic. They poffess‘ed arms and ships, the art of na-
vigation, and the habits of naval war; but the difficulty of iffuiug
through the northern columns of Hercules¹0³ (which, during several
months of the year, are obsti-ueted with ice) confined their skill and

courage within the limits of a spacious lake. The rumour of the

successful armaments which sailed from the mouth of the Elbe„

would soon provoke them to cross the narrow isthmus of Sleswig,
and to launch their vess'els on the great sea. The various troops of
pirates and adventurers, who fought under the same standard, were
insensibly united in a permanent society, at first of rapine, and af-
terwards, of government. A military confederation was gradually
moulded into a national body, by the gentle operation of marriage
and consanguinity3 and the adjacent tribes, who solicited the alli-
ance, accepted the name and laws‚ of the Saxons. If the fa& were
not established by the most unquestionable evidence, we should ap-
pear to abuse the credulity of our readers, by the description of the

vessels in which the Saxon pirates ventured to sport in the war-es
of the German Ocean, the British Channel, and the Bay of Biscay.
