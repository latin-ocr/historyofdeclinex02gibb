THE DECLINE AND FALL

{kilful artists of the times ; a diadem of a new and more ex· Δ
penfive fassxion; a profusion of gems and pearls, of collars and brace-
lets‚ and a variegated flowing robe of filk, most curioussy embroidered·

with flowers of gold. In such apparel, scarcely to be excused by
the youth and folly of Elagabalus, we are at a loss to discover the
wisdom of an aged monarch, and the simplicity of a Roman veteran⁶.
A mind thus relaxed by prosperity and indulgence, was incapable
of rismg to that magnanimity which disdains suspicion, and dares to
forgive. The deaths of NIaximian and Licinius may perhaps be
justified by the maxims of policy, as they are taught in the schools
of tyrants; but an impartial narrative of the execution& or rather
murders, which sullied the deelining age of Constantine, will suggest
to our most candid thoughts, the idea of a prince, who could sacrifice
without reluctance the laws of justice, and the feelings of nature, to
the distates either of his paffions or of his interest.

The same fortune which so invariably followed the standard of
Constantine, seemed to secure the hopes and comforts of his do-
mestic life. Those among his predeceffors who had enjoyed the
longest and most prosperous reigns, Augustus, Trajan, and Diocle—
tian, had been dis-appointed of posterity; and the frequent revolu-
tions had never allowed sufficient time for any Imperial family to
grOW up and multiply under the {hade of the purple. But the
royalty of the Flaviani line, which had been first ennobled by the
«Gothic Claudius, descended through several generations; and Con-
stantine himself derived from his royal father the hereditary honours
which he transmitted to his children. The emperor had been twice
married. Minervina, the obscure but lawful object of his youthful

⁶ Julian, in the Caesars, attempts to ridi- (Orat. c. 5.) alleges, that Constantine drefl‘ed
cule his uncle. His suspicious testimony is for the public, not for himself. W'ere this
confirmed however hythe learned Spanheim‚ admitted, the vainest coxcomb could never
