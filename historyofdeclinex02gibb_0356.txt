THE DECLINE. AND FALL

the remark, that he inherited the defeets, without the abilities, of
,his father. Before Constantius expired, he is said to have named
Julian for his succeffor; nor does it seem improbable, that his anxiatis
concern for the fate of a young and tender wife, whom he left with
child, may have prevailed, in his last moments, over the harffier
paffions of hatred and revenge. Eusebius, and his guilty affociates,
made a faint attempt to prolong the reign of the eunuchs, by the
election of another emperor: but their intrigues were rejected with
disdain by an army which now abhorred the thought of civil dis-
cord3 and two Officers of rank were instantly djspatcloed, to affure

vice. The military defigns of that prince, who had formed three
different attacks against Thrace, were prevented by this fortunate
event. Without ssiedding the blood of his fellow-citizens, he escaped
the danger-s of a doubtful eonfiiet, and acquired the advantages of a
compl-ete vie‘tory. Impatient to vifit the place of his birth, and the

Heraclea, at the distance of fixty miles, all Constantinople was
poured forth to receive him3 and he made his triumphal entry,
amidst the dutiful acclamations of the soldiers, the people, and the
senata, An irmumerable multitude preffed around him with eager ,

finall stature, and stmple garb, of a hero,⁴whose unexperienced youth
had vunqnilhed the Bau-bau-ians of Germany, and who had now
traversed, '111 a successful career, the whole continent of Europe, from
the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Bosphorus⁴³. A few days
