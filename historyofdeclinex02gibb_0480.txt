x-av-e royal race of Constantius Chlorus ww. reduced to his own pers0n3

and if hc entertained any serious thoughts of investing with the·
purple the most worthy among the R «nans, he was divertcd from
his resolution by the difficulty of the cnolce, the jealousy of power,
the fear of ingratitude, and the natural presumption of health, of
youth, and of prosperity. His uncxpefted death left the empire
without a master, and without zm heir, in a state of perplexity and>
danger, which, in the space of sourscore years, had never been ex-
perienced, slnce the eleGdon of Diocletian. In a government, which
had almost forgotten th distinction of pure and noble blood, the
superiority of birth was of little moment ; the claims of official rank
were accidental and pre—carlou& and the candidates, who might
aspire to ascend the vacant throne, could be supported only by the
consciousness of personal merit, or by the hopes of popular favour.

host of Barbarians, ssrortencd the moments of grief and deliberation.
In this scene of terror and distre-ss, the body of the deceastdprince,
according to his own directions, was decently embalmed5 and, at
the dawn of day, the generals convened a military senate, at which
the commanders of the legionS, and the officere, both of cavalry and
infantry, were invited to affist. Three or four hours of the night
had not passed away without some secret cabals ; and when the

agitate the affembly. Victor and Arinthaeus c0}}e6recl the remains
of the court of Constanti-2133 the friends of ltili-an attached them-
selves to the Gallie chiefs, Dagaltiphus and Nevitta3 and the most
fatal consequences might be apprchcnded from the discord of two
