THE DECLINE ΛΝΒ FALL

was originally derived from the charaCter and principles of the Jewish
nat1on.

The simple narrative of the intestine divimus, which distracted
the peace, and dishonoured the triumph„ of the chureh, will confirm
the remark of a pagan historiar), and justify the complaint of a
venerable bissiop. The experience of Ammianus had convinced him,
that the eumity of the Christiane towards each other, surpafled the
fury of savage beasts against man 156; and Gregory Nazianien most
pathetically laments, that the kingdom of heaven was converted‚ by
discord, into the image of chisos, of a nocturnal tempest‚ and of hell
itself ¹⁵⁷. The fierce and partial writers of the times, ascri'bing all
‘virtue to themselves, and imputing all guilt to their adversaries,

have paint-ed the battle of the angele and daemons. Our calmer
reason will reject such pure and perfect monsters of vice or sanetity,

and will impute an equal³ or at least an indiscriminate‚ measure of good
and evil to the hostile seetaries, who astumed and bestowed the ap·-
pellations of orthodox and heretics. They had been educated in
¹the sume religion, and the same civil society. Their hopes and fears
‘in the present, or in a future, life, were balanced in the same pro—
portion. On either fide, the error might be innocent, the faith sm-
-oere, the practice meritorious or corrupt. Their paffions were excited
'by similar objec‘t33 and they might* alternately abuse the stwour of
:the com-t, or of the people. The metaphysica] opinions of the Atha-
nafians and the Ariane, could not influence their moral chal-aetem
and they were alike astuated by the into-lerant spirit, which has
been extrasted from the pure and simple maxims of the gospel.
