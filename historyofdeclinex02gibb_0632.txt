612 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ΧΡξ( &LP- Valens. By the vigour and condue't of Sebastian, a large body of the
μην-4 Goths was surprised in their camp: and the immense spoil, which was
recovered from their hands, filled the city of Hadrianople‚ and the ad-
jacent plain. The splendid narratives, which the general transmitted of

the enemy. The missorumes, as well as the provocatione, of the
