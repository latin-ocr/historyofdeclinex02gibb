THE DECLINE AND FALL

C Π A P. Magnentius was of a more serious and bloody kind. The tyrant

a numerous army, composed of Gauls and Spaniards, of Franks and
S.1xons; of those provincials who supplied the strength of the legions,
and of those barbarians who were dreaded as the most formidable
enemies of the republic. The fertile plains ⁸⁰ of the Lower Pannonia,
between the Dra-ve, the Save, and the Danube, presented a spacious
theatre3 and the operations of the civil war were p1·otra6ted during
the summer months by the ss<ill or timidity of the combatants ⁸¹.
Constantius had declared his intention of deciding the quarrel in the
fields of Cibalis‚ a name that would animate his troops by the re·
membrance of the victory which, on the same auspicious ground,
had been obtained by the arms of his father Constantine. Yet, by
the impregnable fortifications with which the emperor encompaffed
his camp, he appeared to decline, rather than to invite, a general
engagement. It was the objecft of Magnentius to tempt or to com-
pcl his adversary to relinquish this advantageous position3 and he
employed, with that vieW, the various marche& evolutions, and
stratagems, which the knowledge of the art of war could suggest to
an experienced officer. He carried by assault the important town of
Siscia ; made an attack on the city of Sirmium, which lay in the rear
of the Imperial camp3 attempted to force a passage over the Save
into the eastern provinces of Illyricum ; and cut in pieces a numerous

detachment, which he had allured into the narrow passes of Adame.
