too little regard to health ot· convenience, scarcely allowed the in·-v
tervals of narrow streets for the perpetual throng of rnen, of horses„
and of carriages. The allotted space of ground was insufficient to-

The frequent and regular distributions of wine and oil‚ of corn or
bread, of money or provisions, had almost exempted the poorer ci-
tizens of Rome from the necessity of labour. The magnificence of
the first Caesars was in some measure imitated by the founder οἷ’
Constantinople ⁵⁸: but his liberality, however it might excite the
applause of the people, has incurred the censure of posterity. A
nation of legissator-s and conquerors might affert their claim to the*
harvests of Africa, which had been purchased with their blood ; and
it was artfully contrived by Augustus, that, in the enjoyment of

plenty, the Romans should lose the memory of freedom. But the

prodigality of Constantine could not be excused by any consideration
either of public or private interest 3 and the annual tribute of corn
imposed upon Egypt for the benefit of his new capital, was applied
to feed a lazy and insolcnt populace, at the expence of the husband-

men of an industrious province ⁵⁹. Some other regulations of this

emperor are less liable to blame, but they are less deserving of notice,

moles that u cre pushed forwards into the sea;
they confisted of the famous Puzzolan sand,
