THE DECLINE AND FALL

indigi-ration of Constantius, who rcviewed with partia] prejudice the

minutes of the examination. The emperor was eafily convinced,

that his own safety was incompatible with the life of his cousm:
the sentence of death was figned, dispatched, and executed ; and the
nephew of Constantine, with his hands ticd behind his back, was

beheaded in prison like the vilest malesanam-²⁴.

Those who are
inclined to palliate the cruelties of Constantius, affert that he soon
relented, and endeavoured to recall the bloody mandate3 but that
the second meffenger enti-usted with the reprieve, was detained by
the eunuchs, who dreaded the unforgiving temper of Gallus, and
were defirous of re-uniting to their empire the wealthy‘provinces of
the East²⁵.

Belides the reigning emperor, Julian alone survived, of all the
numerous posterity of Constantius Chlorus. The misfortune of his.
royal birth involved him in the disgrace of Gallus. From his retire-
ment in the happy country of Ionia, he was conveyed under a strong
guard to the court of Milan3 where he languissied above-seven
months, in the continual apprehenlion of suffering the same ignomi-
nious death, which was daily inflic‘ted, almost before his eyes, on
the friends and *adherent-s of his persecuted family. His looks, his
gestures, his silence, were scrutinized with malignam curiosity, and
he was perpetually affaulted by enemies, whom he had never of-

fended, and by arts to which he was a stranger ²⁶. But in the school

²4 See the complete narrative of the jour-
ney and death of Gallus in Ammianus, 1.
xiv. c. 11. Julian complains that his bro-
ther was put to death without a trial; at-
tempts tojustify, or at least to excuse, the
cruel reveuge which he had inflit‘ted on his
enemics3 but seems at last to acknowledge
that he might justly have been deprived of
the purple.

²⁵ Philostorgius, l. iv. c. ι. Zonaras,
l. xiii. tom. ii. p. ¹9· But the former was
partial towards an Arian monarch‚ and the

latter transcribed‚ without choice or criti-
cism, whatever he found in the writings of
the ancients.

²⁶ See Ammianus Marcellin. 1. xv. c. 1.
3. 8. Julian himself, in his epistle to the
Athenians‚ draws a very lively and just pic-
ture of his own danger, and of his senti-
ments. He shews, however, a tendency to
exaggerate his sufferingS, by infinuadng,
though in obscure terms, that they lasted
above a year3 a period which cannot be re-
conciled with the truth of chronology. f
