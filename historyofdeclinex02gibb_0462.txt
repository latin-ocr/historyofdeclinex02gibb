THE DECLIN'E AND FALL.

appellation of Coche. Coche was fituate on the western fide of tha:x
Tigris 3 but it was naturally considered as a suburb of Ctefiphon, with*
which we may suppose it to have been conneeted by a permanent!
bridge of boats. The united* parts contributed to form the common,
epithet of Al NIodain, THE CITIES, which the Orientals have be·-
stowed on the winter refidence of the Safl'anides3 and the whole cir--⁴
c-umfercnce of the Perfian capital was strongly fortified by the water&
of the river, by lofty walls, and by impra&ieable moraffes. Near-
the ru'ms of Seleucia, the camp of Julian was-fixed5 and secured, by·-

must have been attended with the total destrue’tion of the Roman

navy. The prudence of the emperor foresaw the* danger, and pro-—

vided the remedy. . As he had minutely studiedthe operations of
Trajan in ‚the sume country, he soon recollffied, that his warlike:
