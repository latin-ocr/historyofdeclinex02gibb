OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

iar enquiry into the-death of a prince, whose reign and person were
soon forgotten‚ appears to have been the only circumstance which
⁴ -countenaneed the malicious whispers of poison and domestic'guilt ¹⁷.
The body of Jovian was sent to Constantinople‚ to be interred with
his predecessor-33 and the sad proceflion was met on the road by his
wife Charito, the daughter of count Lucillian3 who still wept the
recent death of her father, and was hastening to dry her tears
in the embraces os an Imperial husband. ‚Her disappointment
and grief were embittered by the anxiety of maternal tender—
ness. Six weeks before the death of Jovian‚ his infant son had
been placed in the curule chair, adorned with the title of Nobilffmus,
and the vain enfigns of the consulship. Unconscious of his fortune,
the royal youth, who, from his grandfather, afi'umed the name of
Varronian, was reminded only by the jealousy of the government,
that he was the son of an emperor. sixteen years afterwards he
was still alive, but he had already been deprived of an eye3 and his
afflicted mother expched, every hour, that the innocent viC'tim
would be torn from her arms,= to appease, with his blood, the suspi-
cions of the reigning prince ¹⁸.

After the death of Jovian, the throne of the Roman world re-
mained ten days ¹⁹ without a master. The ministers and generals
. still continued to meet in counci13 to exercise their respenffive func-
tions; to maintain the public ordcr3 and peaceably to conduct the
