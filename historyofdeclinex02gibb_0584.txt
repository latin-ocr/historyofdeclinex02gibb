lations of a philosopher 3 and the savage tribes of mankind, as
they approach nearer to the condition of animals, preserve a strongel'
resemblance to themselves and to each other. The uniform stability
of their manners, is the natural consequence of the imperfection of
their faculties. Reduced to a similar situation, their wants, their

defu-es, their enjoyments, still continue the same: and the influence
of food or climate, which, in a more improved state of society, is
suspended, or subdued, by so many moral causes, most powerfully
contributes to form, and to maintain, the national charadier of Bar-
barians. «In every age, the immense plains of Scythia, or Tartary‚
have been inhabited by vagi-ant tribes of hunters and lhepherds,
whose indolence refuses to cultivate the earth, and whose restless
spirit disdains the confinement of a· sedentary life. In every
age, the Scythians, and Tartars, have been renowned for their in-

vincible courage, and rapid conquests. The thrones of Asia have
been repeatedly overturned by the {hepherds of the North 3¹ and their
arms have spread terror and devastation over thc most fertile and
warlike countries of Europe ⁶. On this occasion, as well as ort
many others, the sober historiar] is forcibly awakened from a pleas-
ing vifion 3 and is compelled‚ with some reluffihmce, to confess, that
the pastoral manners, which have been adorned with the fairest at-
tributes of peace and innocence, are much better adapted to the
fierce and cruel habits of a military life. To illustrate this observa-
tion, I shall now proceed to consider a nation of shepherds and of
