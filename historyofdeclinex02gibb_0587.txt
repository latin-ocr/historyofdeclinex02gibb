oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 567

a hasty march, they provide themselves with ῃ sufficient quantity of Cxpkfff·

little balls of cheese, or rather of hard ειη-ἀ, which they occasion· zm
ally diffolve in water3 and this [insubstantial diet will support5 for
many days, the life, and even the spirits, of the patient warrior.
But this extraordinary abstinencie, which tlie Stoic would approve,
and the hermit might envy, is commonly succeeded by the most
voracious indulgence of appetite. The wines of a happier climate
are the most grateful present, *or the most valuable commodity, that

unite the different advantages of simplicity and refinement. The
individuals of the same tribe are constantly ass'embled‚ but they are
affembled in a c21mp3 and the native spirit of these dauntless {hep-
herds is animated by mutual support and emulation. The houses of
the Tartars are no more than small tent& of an oval form, which

afford a cold and dirty habitationa for the promiscuous youth of both
sexes,
