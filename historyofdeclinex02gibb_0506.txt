THE DECLlNE AND FA'LL

The invitation of the ministers and generals at Nice was of little
moment, unless it were confirmed by the voicex of the army. The
aged Sallust, who had long obierved the irregular fluctuatione. of
popular affemblies, proposed, under pain of death, that none of
those persons, whose rank in the service might excite a party in their
favour, should appear in public, on the day of the inauguration.
Yet such was the prevalence of ancient superstition, that a whole
‚day-was voluntarily added to this dangerous interval, because it hap-
pened to be the intercalation of the Biffextile ²4. At length, when the
hour was supposed to be propitious‚ Valentinian sslewed himself
from a lofty tribunal: the judicious choice was applauded ; ⁷ and the
new prince was solemnly invested with the diadem and the purple,
amidst the acclamations of the troops, who were disposed in martial ι
order round the tribunal. But when he stretched forth his hand to
,address the armed multitude, a busy whisper was accidentally started
in the ranks, and insensibly swelled into a loud and imperious cla-
mour‚ that he should name, without delay, a collcague in the em-
pire. The intrepid calmness of Valentinian obtained filence, and
commanded respect: and he thus addreffed the affcmbly; “ A few
“ minutes fince it was in your power, fellow-soldiers, to have left

“ mony of my past lise, that Ι deserved to reign, you have placed me
“ on the throne. It is now my duty to consult the safety and interest
“ of the republic. The weight of the universe is undoubtedly to’o
“ great for the hands of a feeble mortal. Ι am conscious of the
‘⁸' limits of my abilitics, and the uncertainty of my life: and far
