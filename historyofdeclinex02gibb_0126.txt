As they depended much more on their own vamur, than on the expe-
rience or the abilities of their chief, they filcnced by their elamours
his timi'd 1·emonstrances; and rushing with fury to the charge, filled
up the ditch, broke down the rampart, and dispersed themselves
through the tems, to recruit their exhausted strength, and to enjoy the
rich harvest of their labours. But the prudent Sapor had watched
the moment of vinffory. His army, of which. the greater part, se-

d1·eadful.ssaughter‚ and that the flying remnant of the legions was
exposed to the most intolerable hardssiips. Even the tenderness of
panegyric, confeffing that the glory of the emperor was sullied by
the disobedience of his soldiers‚ chuses to draw a veil over the cir-
cumstances of this melancholy retreat.. Yet one of those venal ora-
tors, so jealous of the fame of Constantius, relates with amazing
coolness, an a& of such incredible cruelty, as, in the judgment ofv
posterity, must imprint a far deeper stain on the honour of the Im—
perial name. The son of Sapor, the heir of his crown, had been

scounged, tortured‚ and publicly executed by the inhumari Ro-

mans ⁶².
