THE DECLINE AND FALL

thrown into the sea; and the-popular leaders of the tumult declared
their resolution to disappoint the devotion of the Christians, and to
inter-cept the future honours of these martyrs, who had been pu-
niffied, like their predecessore, by the enemies of their religion ¹²¹.
The fears of the Pagans were just, and their precautions ineffec‘cual.
The meritorious death of the archbishop obliterated the memory of
his life. The rival of Athanafius was dear and sacred to the Arians,
and the seeming conversion of those sectaries introduced his worship
into the bosom of the Cathoiic church ¹²². The odious stranger, dis-
guislng every circumstance of time and place, affumed the mall< of

a martyr, a saint, and a Christian hero ¹²³3 and the infamous George
of Cappadocia has been transformed '²⁴ into the renowned St. George
of England‚ the patron of arms, of chivalry, and of the garter¹²⁵.
About the same time that Julian was informed of the tumult of
Alexandria, he received intelligence from Edessa, that the proud and
wealthy faction of the Arians had insulted the weakness of the Va-
lentinian53 and committed such disorders‚ as ought not to be suffered

with impunity in a well—regulated state. without expecting the

¹²¹ Cineres projecit in mare, id metuens ut
clamabat, ne, collectis supremiS, aedcs illis
exstruerent5 ut reliquis, qui deviare a religione
compulsi, pertulere cruciabiles poenas, adusque
gloriosam mortem intemerata fide progressi,
et nunc B¹1ARTYRES appellantur. Ammian-
xxii. ιι, Epiphanius proves to the Arians,
that George was not a martyr.

¹²² Some Donatists (Optatus Milev. p. 60.
303. edit. Dupin; and Tine-mont, Mrem.
Eccles. tom. vi. p. 713. in 4to) and Priscil-
lianists (Tilvlemonn Mem. Eccles. tommdii.
p. 517. in 4to) have in ]ike manner usurped
the honours of Catholic saints and martyrs.

¹²³ The saints of Cappadocia, Bafil and the
Gregories, were ignorant of their holy com-
panion. Pope Gelasius (A. D. 494), the first
Catholic who acknowledges St. George,
‘places him among the martyrs, “ qui Deo
u magis quarn hominibus noti sunt? He

rejects his Acts as the composition of heretico.
Some, perhaps not the oldest, of the spu-
rious Acis, are still extant3 and, through a
cloud of fiffion, we may yet distinguish the
combat which St. Geor-ge of Cappadocia
sustained, in the presence of Qeen Alexan-
dra, against the magician Athanasius.

¹²⁴ This transformation is not given as

absolutely certain, but as extremely probable. ,

¹²⁵ A curious history of the worship of
St. George, from the {ixth century (when he
was already revered in Palestine, in Armo-
nia‚ at Rome, and at Treves in Gaul), might
be extrae'ted from Dr. Heylin (History of
St. George, zd edition, London 1033, in
4to‚ pp. 429.), and the Bollandists (Ad. SS.
Mens. April. tom. iii. p. ιω· 163.). His
farne and popularity in Europe, and especially
in England, proceeded from the CrusadeS.
