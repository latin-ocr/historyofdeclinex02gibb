C JX‘} P. unanimoussy received as a fundamental article of the Christian faidx,

ὲ-ῆν-θ by the consent of the Greek, theLatin, the Oriental‚ and the Pro-
testant churches. But if the same word had not served to stigmatize
the heredes, and to unite the Catholics, it would have been inad-
equatc to the purpose of the majority, by whom it was introduced
into the orthodox crccd. This majority was divided into two par-
ties, distinguished by a contrary tendeney to the sentiments of the
Tritheists and of the Sabellianss. But as those opposite extremes
seemcd to overthrow the foundations either of natural, or revealed'¹
religion, they mutually agreed to qnalify the rigour of their prin-
ciples z and to disavow the just, but invidious‚ consequences, which
might be urged by their antagonists. The interest of the common
cause inclined them to join their numbers, and to conceal their dif-
ference83 their animolity was sostened by the healing counsele of
toleration, and their disputes were suspended by the use of the mys-
terious Homoozgfion, which either party was free to interpret accord-
ing to their peculiar tenets. The Sabellian sense, which, about
fifty years before, had obliged the council of Antioch ⁵⁷ to prohibit
this celebrated term, had endeared it to those theologians who enter-

more fashionable saints of the Arian times, the intrepid Athanafius,
the learned Gregory Nazianzen, and the other pillars of the chureh,
who supported with ability and success the Nicene doeh-ine, appeared
to confider the expression of fitlgstcmce, as if it had been synonimous

with that of nature 3 and they ventured to illustrate their meaning,
by affirming that three men, as they belong to the same common

species, are consubstantial or homoouslan to each other⁵⁸. This pure
