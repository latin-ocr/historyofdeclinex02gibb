THE DECLINE AND FALL

cil, with the schismatic followers of Meletius ⁹⁶. Athanafius had
openly disapproved that ignominious peace, and the emperor was
disposed to believe, that he had abused his ecclefiastical and civi]

power, to persecute those odious sedarieffi that he had sacrilegioussy

'broken a chalice in one of their churches of Maraeotis3 that he had

whipped or imprisoned six of their bishop83 and that Arsenius, a
‘seventh bisnop of the same party, had been murdered, or at least
mutilated, by the cruel hand of the primate ⁹⁷. These charges,

which affected his honour and his life, were referred by Constantine

to his brother Dalmatius the Censor, who refided at Antioch3 the

synods of Caesarea and Tyre were succeffively convened3 and
the bishops of the East were instruet-ed to judge the cause of
Athanafius, before they proceeded to consecrate the new church
of the Resurreffion at Jerusalem. The primate might be con-
scions of' his innocence3 but he was senlible, that the same impla-
cable spirit which had dietat& the accusation, would direct t‘he pro—
ceeding, and pronounce the sentence. He prudently declined the
tribunal of his enemies, despised the summotis of the synod of Cae-
sarea; and, after a long and artful delay, submitted to the peremp-
‘tory commands of the emperor, who threatened to punish his cri-
minal disobedience if he refused to appear in the council of Tyre ⁹³.
Before Athanasius, at the head of fifty Egyptian pielates, sailed

from Alexandria, he had wisely secured the alliance of the Meletians 3

⁹⁶ The Meletians in Egypt, like the Do-
natists in Africa, were produced by an epis-
copal quarrel which arose 'from the persecu-
tion. I have not leisure to pursue the ob-
scure controversy, which seems to have been
misrepresented by the partiality of Athana-
sius, and the ignorance of Epiphanius. See
‘Mosheim’s General History of the Church,
vol. i. p. 201.

⁹⁷ The treatment of the fix bissiops is spe-
.cified by Sozornen (l. ii. c. 25.); but Atha-

nasius himself, so copious on the subjeft of
Arsenius and the chame, leaves this grave
accusation without a reply.

9³ Athanas. tom. i. p. 788. Socrates,
l. i. c. 28. Sozomen, 1. ii. c. 25. The
emperor, in his Epistle of Convocation
(Euseb. in Vit. Constant, l. iv. c. 42.),
seems to prejudge some members of the
clei-gy, and it was more than probable that
the synod would apply those reproaches to

Athanasius.
