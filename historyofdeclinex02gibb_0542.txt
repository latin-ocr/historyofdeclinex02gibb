THE DECLINE AND FALL

sures had not been defeated by the impatience of the troops. Ma-
crianus was afterwards admitted to the honour of a personal con-
ference with the emperor3 and the favours which he received,
fixed him, till the hour of his death, a steady and sincere friend of
the republic ¹⁰⁰.

The land was covered by the fortifications of Valentinian3 but
the sea-coast of Gaul and Britain was exposed to the depredatione of
the Saxons. That celebrated name, in which we have a dear and
domestic interest, escaped the notice of Tacitus; andin the maps of
Ptolemy2 it faintly marks the narrow neck of the Cimbric penin-
sula, and three small issands towards the. mouth of the Elbe¹⁰¹. This
contracted territory, the present Duchy of Sleswig, or perhaps of-
Holstein, was incapable of pouring forth the inexhaustible swarms
of Saxons who reigned over the ocean, who filled the Britissi issand
with their language‚ their laws, andtheir colon-ie33 and who so long
defended the liberty of the North against the arms of Charlemagne ¹⁰².
The solut-ion of this difficulty is eafily derived from the fimilar
manners, and loose constitution, of the tribes of Germany3 which
were blended with each other by the ssightest accidente of war or

’ friendship. The situation of the native Saxons disposed them to

embrace the hazardous professions of fishermen. and pirates: and the

success of their first adventures would naturally excite the emula?
