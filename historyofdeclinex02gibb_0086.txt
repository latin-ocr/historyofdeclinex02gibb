of the public impolitions. The latter of these sums was divided by

h——v-—J the former3 and the estimate, that such a province contained so many

capita, or heads of tribute3 and that each head was rated at such a
price, was universally received, not only in the popular, but even -
in the legal computation. The value of a tributary head must have
varied, according to many accidenffl, or at least fluctuating circum—-
stances3 but some knowledge has been preserved of a very curione.
fao, the more important, fince it relates to one of the richest pro-—
vinces of the Roman empire, and which now flonrisst-es as the most
splendid of the European kingdoms. The rapacious ministers of
Constantius had exhausted the wealth of Gaul, by exacting twenty-
five pieces of gold for the annual tribute of every head. The humane
policy of his success'or reduced the capitation to seven pieces ¹⁷⁹.
A moderate proportion between these opposite extremes of extraor-
dinary oppreflion and of transient indulgence, may therefore be fixed
at fixteen pieccs of gold, or about nine pounds sterling, the com-

¹⁸⁰ In the calculation -of any sum of mo-
ney under Constantine and his successbrS, we
need only refer to the excellent discourse
of Mr. Greaves on the Denarius, for the
proof of the following principles: 1. That
the ancient and modern Roman pound‚
containing 5256 grains of Troy weight‚ is
about one twelsth lighter than the English
pound‚ which is composed of 5760 of the
same grains. 2. That the pound of gold,

aurei, was at this time coined into seventy-
two smaller pieces of the same denomination.
3. That five of these aurei were the legal
tendet for a pound of filver, and that conse-
quently the pound of gold was exchanged
for fourteen pounds eight ounces of filver,
according ro the Roman, or about thirteen
pounds according to the English, weight. 4.
That the Englilh pound of silves is coined
into sixty-two ffiillings. From these ele-
ments we may compute the Roman pound of
gold, the usual method of reckoning large
sums, at forty pounds sterling3 and we may
fix the currency of the aureus at somewhat
more than elevcn strillings.
