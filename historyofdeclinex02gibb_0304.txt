The fall of Liberius and Osius reflected a brighter lustre on
the ssrmness of those bishops who still adhered, with unss1aken fide-
lity, to the cause of Athanasius and religious truth. The ingenious

the most barbarous tradis of Cappadocia, were less inhospitable than

which they soon enjoyed of observing the intestine divifions of
the adversaries of the Nicene faith. Such was the nice and capri-
