THE DECLINE AND FALL

counts of the domestics had succeeded to the office of the Praeto'-
rian praefee‘c33 like the praefeets, they aspired from the service of
the palacc to the command of armies.

The perpetual intercourse between the court and the provinces was
facilitated by the construetimi of roads and the institution of posts.
But these benefieial establissiments were accidentally connected with
a pernicious and intolerable abuse. Two or three hundred agents or

the offices, to announce the names of the annual consuls, and the
edhsts or vietories of the emperors. They insensibly assumed the
licence of reporting whatever they could observe of the conclu&
either of magistrates or of private citizens; and were soon con-

Under the warm influence of a feeble reign, they multiplied to the
incredible number of ten thousand, disdained the mild though fre-
quent admonitions of the laws‚ and exercised in the profitable ma·

every treasonable design, from the faint and latent symptoms of dis-
affeffion, to the actual preparation of an open revolt. Their careless
or criminal violation of truth and justice was covered by the conse-
crated mall< of zeal; and they might securely aim their poisoned
arrows at the breast either of the guilty or the innocent, who had
provoked their resentment, or refused to purchase their silence. A
faithful subject, of Syria perhaps, or of Britain, was exposed to the
danger, or at least to the dread, of being dragged in chains to
