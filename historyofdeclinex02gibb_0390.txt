THE DECLINE ‚AND FALL

in the impious list of the enemies of Christianity, the celebrated
name of Porphyry was effaced by the superior merit or reputation
of Julian. The minds of the faithful were either seduced, or scan-
dalized, or alarmed; and the pagane, who sometimes presumed to
engage in the unequal dispute‚ derived, srorn the popular work of their
Imperial miffionary, an inexhaustible supply ofTallacious objeefions.
But in the affiduous prosecution of these theological studies, the
emperor of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and pallions
of a polemic divine. He contracted an irrevocable obligation, to
maintain and propagate his religious opinions 3 and whilst he secretly
applauded the strength and dexterity with which he wielded the
weapons of controversy, he was tempted to distrust the fincerity, or
to despise the understandings‚ of his antagonists, who could obstinately
refist the force of reason and eloquence.

The Christians‚ who beheld with horror and indignation the apos-

tacy of Julian, had much more to sear from his power than from
his arguments. The pagans, who were conscious of his fervent

zeal‚ expe&ed, perhaps with impatience, that the flames of persecution

should be immediately kindled against the enemies of the gods 3 and
that the ingenious malice of Julian would invent some cruel refine—

ments of death and torture, which had been unknown to the rude and

¹ inexperienced fury of his predeceffors. But the hopes, as well as the

fears, of the religious {actions were apparently disappointed‚ by the
prudent humanity of a prince³³, who was careful of his own fame, of
the public peace, and of the rights of mankind. Instru&ed by history

and reflectiom Julian was persuaded, that if the diseases of the body
may sometimes be cured by salutary violence, neither steel nor fire
