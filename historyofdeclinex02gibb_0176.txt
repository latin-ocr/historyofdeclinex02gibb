156 THE DECLINE AND FALL

κ-Ὗ-Ἀ sztfety, displaycd in the prosecution of the siege, the ardor of a youth-
sul soldier. After an obstinate combat the Bai-basians were repulsed3
they incessantly returned to the charge 3 they were again driven back
with a dreadful ssaughter, and two rebel legions of Gauls, who had
been banishcd into the East, signalized their undisciplined courage by
a nocturnal sally into the heart of the Persian camp. In one of the ¹

of Amida, and the works of Sapor were more than once destroyed
by the fire of the Romans. But the resources of a besieged
city may be exhausted. The Perfians repaired their loffes, and
