THE DECLINE AND FALL

The harbour of Constandwple, which may be confidered as an
arm of the Bosphorus, obtained, in a very remote Period‚ the de-
nomination of the Golden Horn. The curve which it describes might
be compared to the horn of a stag, or, as it should seem, with more
propi-lew, to that of an ox ¹¹. The epithet of golden was expreflive
of the riches which every wind wasted from the most distant coun-
tries into the secure and capacious port of Constantinople. The river
Lycus, formed by the conflux of two little streams, pours into the
harbour a perpetual supply of fresh water, which serves to cleanse
the bottom‚ and to invite the periodical ssmals of fifh to seek their
retreat in that convenient recess. As the viciffitudes of tides are
scarcely felt in those seas, the constant depth of the harbour allows
goods to be lauded on the quays without the aflistance of boats; and
it has been observed‚ that in many places the largest veffels may rest
their prows against the houses, while their sterns are Hoating in the
water ¹². From the mouth of the Lycus to that of the harbour,

this arm of the Bosphorus is more than seven miles in length. The
entrance is about five hundred yards broad, and a strong chain could
be occafionally drawn across it, to guard the port and city from the
attack of an hostile navy ¹³.

Between the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, the shores of Europe
and Asia receding on either fide inclose the sea of Marmara, which
was known to the ancients by the denomination of Propontis. The
navigation from the iffue of the Bosphorus to the entrance of the
