THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P. disgrace, the conquest of the East was immediately followed by

ι-ημ-α an edi& which announced their total destruction ¹. After a

preamble filled with paffion and repromh, Constantine absolutely
prohibits the affemblies of the Heretics, and confiscates their public
property to the use either of the revenue or of the Catholic church.
The sedis against whom the Imperial severity was directed, appear to
have been the adherents of Paul of Samosata ; the Montanists of
Phrygia, who maintained an enthusiastic suceeffion of prophecy3 the
Novatians, who sternly rejeffed the temporal efficacy of repentance3
the Marcionites and Valenfinians, under whose leading banners the
various Gnostics ofAfia and Egypt had insenfibly rallied ; and perhaps
the Manichaeans, who had recently imported‘ from Perfia a more
artful composition of Oriental and Christian theology ². The
delign of extirpating the name, or at least of restraining the pro-

gress of these odi·ous Heretics, was prosecuted with vigour and effect.
Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Dio-
cletian3 and this method of converslon was applauded by the same
bishops who had felt the hand of oppreffion, and had pleaded
for the rights of humanity. Two immaterial circumstances may
serve, however, to prove that the mind of Constantine was not
entirely corrupted by the spirit of zeal and bigoti·y. Before he con-

whose learning and moderation he justly esteemed3 and of whose
