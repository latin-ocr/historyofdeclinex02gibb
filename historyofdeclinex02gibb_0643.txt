OF THE *ROMAN EMPIRE.

The emperor Gratian was far advanced on his march towards the
plains of Hadrianople, when he was inf01·med‚ at first by the con-
fused voice of fame, and afterwards by the more accurate reports of
Victor and Richomer, that his impatient colleague had been ssain in
battle, and that two-thirds of the Roman army were exterminated
by the sword of the victorious Goths. VVhatever resentment the
rath and j‘ealous vanity of his uncle might deserve‚ the resentment
of a generous mind is easily subdued by the foster emotions of grief
and compaffion: and even the sense of pity was soon lost in the se·-
rious and alarming consideration of the state of the republic. Gratian
was too late to affist, he was too weak to revenge, his unfortunate
colleague ; and the valiant and modest youth felt himself unequal to>
the support of a sinking world. A formidable tempest of the Bar-
bau-iaus of Germany seemed ready to burst over the provinces of Gaul 3,
and the mind of Gratia‘n was oppreffed, and distraCted, by the ad-
ministration, of the XVestern Empire. In this important crisis, the
government of the East, and the conduet of the Gothic war, re-
quired the undivided attention of a hero and a statesman. A
subje& invested with such ample command would not long have
preserved his fidelity to a distant benefacton and the Imperial council
embraced the wise and manly resolution, of conferi-ing an obligatmn,
rather than of yielding to an insult. Itwas the wilh of Gratias} to
bestow the purple as the reward of virtue3 but, {tt the age of nine·-
teen, it is not easy for a prince, educated in the supreme rank, to
understand-the true charaeters of his ministers and generals. He
attempted to weigh, with an impartial hand, their various mer-its and
(lefec‘ts3 and, whilst he checked the rash conlidence of ambition, he
distrusted the cautious wisdom, which despaired of the republic. As
each moment of delay diminished something of the power and re-
sources of the future sovereign of the East, the situation of the times

would not allow a tedious debate. The choico of Gratias} was soon
declax-ed
