Before he took the field, he devolved on the provincial governors,
most of the public and private causes which had been referred to
his tribunal ; but, on his return, he carefully revised their proceedings„
mitigated the rigour of the law, and pronounced a second judgment
on the judges themselves. Superior to the last temptation of vir-

for his fignatul‘e3 and the faithful pi&ure of the puJic misery, by
Which he had been obliged to justify his refusal, offended the court
of Constantius. We may enjoy the pleasure of reading the senti-
