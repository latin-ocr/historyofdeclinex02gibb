to about two thousand English acres. It is impoflible to justify the

may perhaps authorise the measure of a Byzantine historiam, who*

strufted in the year 4¹3· In 447 it was
thrown down by an earthquake, and rebuilt
in three months by the diligence of the prze-
fe& Cyrus. The suburb of the Blachernae
was first taken into the city in the reign of
Heraclius. Ducange Const. l. i. e. ιο, 11.

³3 The measurcment is express‘ed in the
Notitia by 14‚075feet. It is reasonable to
suppose that these were Greek feet; the pro-
portion of which has been ingenioussy deter-
mined by M. d‘Anville. He compares the
180 feet with the 78 Hashemite cubsts, which
in different writers are affigned for the height
of St. Sophia Each of these cubits was
equal to 27 Freneh inches.

³⁴ The accur‘zre Thevenot (l. i. c, ις.)
walked in one honr an?L three quarters round
two of the fides of the triangie‚ from the
Kiolk of the Seraglio to the ieven tenses».
D’Anville examines with care, and receives
with confidence, this decix'ive testimony, which
gives a circumference of ten or twelve viiie„
The extravagant computation of Tonrncfott
(Lettre XI.) of thirty—four or thirty miles,

without including Scutari, is a strange de-
parture from his usual charaeier.

³⁵ The sycae, or fig-trees, formed the thir-
teenth region, and were very much embel-
lished by justinian. It ha since borne the
names of Pera and Galata. The etymology
of the former is obvious; that of the latter is
unknown. Sec Ducange Const, l. i. c. 22.
