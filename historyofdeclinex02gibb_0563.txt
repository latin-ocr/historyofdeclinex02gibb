cautious meaffires, to support the Roman party in the kingdoms
of Iberia and Armenia. Twelve legions established the authority
of Sauromaces* on the banks of the Cyrus. The Euphrates
was protected by the valour of Arintheus. A powerful army,
under the command of count Trajan, and of Vadomair, king of
the Alemanni, fixed their camp on the confines of Armenia. But
they were strictly enjoined, not to commit the first hostilities‚ which
might be understood as a breach of the treaty: and such was the
implicit obedience of the Roman general, that they retreated, with
exemplary patience, under a {hower of Persian arrovvs, till they had
clearly acquired a just title to an honour-able and leo-itimate victory,
Yet these appearances of war insensibly subfided in a vain and tedious

tual reproaches of perfidy and ambition; and it should seem, that
the original treaty was expreffed in very obscure terins, since they

new maxims of tranquillity and moderatiou. His d 2ath which A. D. 380,
