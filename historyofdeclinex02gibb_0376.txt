state of irreconcilable hostility with a very numerous party of his

the shame of a repulse, to violate the laws of prudence, and even of
justice. The triumph of the party, which he deserted and opposed,
has fixed a stain of infamy on the name of Julian3 and the unsuc-
cessful apostate has been overwhehned with a torrent of pious invec-
tives, of which the signal was given by the sonorous trumpet ²of
Gregory Nazianzen³. The interesting nature of the events Which
were crowded into the short reign of this active emperor, deserve a
Just and circumstantial narrative. His motives, his counsels, and his-
aefions, as far as they are conneered With the history of religion, will

² The orator, with some eloquence, much
enthusiasm, and more vanity‚ addreffes his
discourse to heaven and earth, to men and
angels, to the living and the dead3 and
above all, to the great Constantius (ει τις
