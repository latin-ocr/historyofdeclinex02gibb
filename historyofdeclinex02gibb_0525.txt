Jews, and all the various seets which acknowledged the divine C {JXQP-
authority of Christ, were protected by the laws from arbitrary power k-v--l
or popular insuit 3 nor was any mode of worssiip prohibited by Va-
lentinian, except those secret and crimina] practices, which rabused
the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and disorder.
The art of magle, as it was more cruelly punissicd, was more stric‘ily
proscribed3 but the emperor admitted a formal distinetion to protect
the ancient methods of divinati0n‚ which were approved by the se—

with the consent of the most rational Pagans, the licence of noc·-
turnal sacrifices3 but he immediately admitted the petition of Prae-
textatus, proconsul of Achaia, who represented, that the life of the
Greeks would become dreary and comfortless, if they were deprived

of the invaluable bleffing of the Eleusiniam mysteries. Philosophy
zilone can boast (and perhaps it is no more than the boast of philo-
sophy), that her gentle hand is able to eradicate from >the human
mind the latent and deadly principle of fanaticism. But this truce of

ment of Valentinian, by suspending the repetition of mutual in-
juries, contributed to soften the manners, and abate the prejudices,

the West had extricated themselves from the suares of the creed of ξὶῑὲἓῗςὲὴε

Rimini, they happily relapsed into the ssumber of orthodoxy3 and A.D. 367-
the small remains of the Arian party, that still sublisted at Sirmium 378·

or Milan, might be considered, rather as objeecs of contempt than of
