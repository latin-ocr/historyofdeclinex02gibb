OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

those robbers descended from their craggy mountains to ravage the
adjacent country, and had even presumed, though without success,
to befiege the important city of Seleucia, which was defended by a
garrison of three Roman legions. Above all, the Persian monarch,
elated by victory, again threatened the peace of Asta, and the pre-
sence of the emperor was indispensably required, both in the west,
and in the East. For the first time, Constantius smeerely acknow-
ledged, that his single strength was unequal to such an extent of
care and of dominion ³⁰. Insenfible to the voice of flattery, which
afi'ured him that his all-powerful virtue, and celestial fortune, would
still continue to triumph over every obstacle, he listened with com-
placency to the advice of Eusebia, which gratified his indolence,
without offending his suspicious pride. As she perceivecl that the
remembrance of Gallus (lwelt on the emperor's mind, ssie artfully
turned his attention to the opposite characters of the two brothers,
which from their infancy had been compared to‘those of Domitian
and ofi Titus ³¹. She accustomed her hulband to consider Julian as a
youth of a mild unambitious disposition, whose allegiance and gra-
titude might be secured by the gift of the purple, and who was
qualified to fill, with honour, a subordinate station, without aspiring
to dispute the commands, or to {hade the glories, of his sovereigu
and l)enef21&oi·. After an obstinate, though secret struggle, the op—
position of the favourite eunuchs submitted to the ascendency of the
empress ; and it was resolved that Julian, after celebrating his nup—
tials with Helena, sister of Constantius, lhould be appointed, with
the title of Caesar, to reign over the countries bey-ond the Alps ³².
