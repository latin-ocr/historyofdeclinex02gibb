THE DECLINE AND FALL

most celebrated profeffors of the Christian saith, of the Grecian phi-
losophy, and of the Roman'jurisprudencq were invited by the li-
berality of the emperor, who reserved for himself the important talk
of instruosting the royal youths in the science of government, and the
knowledge of mankind. But the genius of Constantine himself had
been formed by adverslty and experience. In the free intercourse of
private life, and amidst the dangers of the court of Galerius, he had
learned to command his own paffions, to encounter those of his
equals, and to depend for his present safety and future greatness on
the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct. His destined
successore, had the misfortune of being born and educated in the Im-
perial purple. Incessantly surrounded with a train of flatterers,
they paffed their youth in the enjoyment of luxury and the expeeca-
tion of a throne; nor would the dignity of their rank permit them
to descend from that elevated station from whence the various cha-
racters of human nature appear to wear a smooth and uniform aspect.
The indulgence of Constantine admitted them, at a very tender age,
to share the administration of the empire; and they studied the art
of reigning at the expence of the people entrusted to their care. The
younger Constantine was appointed ‘to hold his court in Gaul3 and
his brother Constantius exchanged that department, the ancient pa-
trimony of their father, for the more opulent, but less martial, coun-
tries of the East. Italy, the Western Illyricum, and Africa, were
accustomed to revere Constans, the third of his sons, as the repre-
sentative of the great Constantine. He fixed Dalmatius on the
Gothic frontier, to which he annexed the government of Thrace,
Nlacedonia, and Greece. The city of Caesarea was chosen for the
refidence of Hannibalianus3 and the provinces of Pontus, Cappa-
doda, and the Leffer Armenia, were defigned to form the extent of
his new kingdom. For each of these princes a suitable establiffi-
ment was provided. A just proportion of guarde, of legions, and
of auxiliaries, was allotted for their respective dignity and defence.
