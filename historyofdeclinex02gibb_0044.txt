THE DECLINE AND FALL

But ,when they lost even the semblance of those

Α--Ν virtues which were derived from their ancient freedom, the fimpli-

city of Roman manners was insenlihly corrupted by the stately affec-

tation of the courts of Asia. The distixiclions of personal merit and

influence, so conspicuous in a republiC, so feeble and obscure under a
monarchy, were abolished by the despotifin of the emperors; who
substituted in their room a severe subordination of rank and office,
frorh the -titled ssaves who were seated on the steps of the throne, to
the meanest instruments of arbitrary power. This multitude of
abject dependents was interested in the support of the actual govern—
ment, from the dread of a revolution, which might at once con-
found their hopes, and intercept the reward of their services. In this
divine hierarchy (for such it is frequently styled), every rank was
marked with the most scrupulous exaemess, and its dignity was dis-
played in a variety of trifling and solemn ceremonies, which it was
a study to learn, and a sacrilege to neglect ⁷4. The purity of the
Latin languagewas debased, by adopting‚ in the intercourse of pride
and flattery‚ a profusion of epithets, which Tully would scarcely
have understood, and which Augustus would have rejected with

by the sovereign himself, with the deceitful titles of your Sincerity,

from the style of sreedom and fimplichy, to
that of form and servitude, may be traced in
the Epissles of Cicero, of Pliny, and of Sym-
