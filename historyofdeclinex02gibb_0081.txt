OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

perpetually hung over the heads of the principa} citizens of the
Roman world ¹⁶⁷.

These evils, however terrible they may appear, were confined to
the smaller number of Roman subjectis, whose dangerous situation
was in some degree compensated by the enjoyment of those ad·-
⁷ vantages‚ either of nature or of fortune, which exposed them to the
jealousy of the monarch. The obscure millions of a great empire
have much less to dread from the cruelty than from the avarice of
their master33 and their humble happiness is principally affected by
the grievance of exceffive taxes, which gently preffing on the wealdry,
descend with accelerated weight on the meaner and more indigent
claffes of society. An ingenious philosopher ¹⁶⁸ has calculated the
universal measure of the public impolitions by the degrees of free⁴
dom and servitude3 and ventures to assem, that, according to an
invariable law of nature, it must always increase with the former,
and diminish in a just proportion to the latter. But this refletlion,
which would tend to alleviate the miseries of despoffism, is contra-
dieted at least by the history of the Roman e1npire3 which accuses
the same princes of despoiling the senate of its authority, and the
provinces of their wealth. Without abolishing all the various cust01n÷
and duties on merchandizes, which are imperceptibly discharged by the
apparent choice of the purchaser, the policy of Constantine and hig
successore preferred a simple and dire& mode of taxation, more con=
genial to the spirit of an arbitrary governxnent ¹⁶⁹.
