had already exceeded the most ample measure of a great city. “ I

‘⁶ guide who marches before me, thinks proper to stop ²⁹.'’ Without
presuming to investigate the nature or motives of this extraordinary
condue'tor, we shall content ourselves with the more humble task of
describing the extent and limits of Constantinople ³0.

In the aetual state of the city, the palace and gardens of the Se-
raglio occupy the eastern promontory, the first of the seven hills‘, and
cover about one hundred and fifty acres of our own measure. The
seat of Turkilh jealousy and despotism is e1·ec‘ted on the foundations

-of a Grecian republic: but it rnay be supposed that the Byzantines

were tempted by the conveniency of the harbour to extend their ha—
bitations on that fide beyond the modern limits of the Seraglio. The
new walls of Constantine stretched from the port to the Propontis
across the enlarged breadth of the triangle‚ at the distance of fifteen
stadia from the ancient fortification3 and with the city of Byzantium
they inclosed five of the seven hills, which, to the eyes of those who
approach Constantinople‚ appear to rise above each other in beautiful
order ³¹. About a century after the death 'of the founder, the new·
buildings, extending on one fide up the harbour, and on the other
along the Propontis, already covered the narrow ridge of the fixth,

and the broad summit of the seventh hill. The neceffity of pro-
tedling those suburbs from the inceffant inroads of the Barbarians,

engaged the younger Theodolius to surround his capital with au
