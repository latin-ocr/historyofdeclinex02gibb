THE DECLINE AND FALL

great council of Rimini‚ which aspired to universal freedom, was
successfully resisted by the sou of Constantine ¹⁰⁹.

IV. The Latin clergy, who credied their tribunal on the ruins of
the civil and common law, have modestly accepted as the gift of
Constantine¹¹⁰, the independent jurisdiecion which was the fruit of
time, of accident, and of their own industry. But the liberality of
the Christian emperors had aCkually endowed them with some legal
prerogatives, which secured and dignified the sacerdotal character ¹¹¹.
ι. Under a despotic government, the bishops alone enjoyed and asserted
the inestimable privilege of being tried only by their pcers; and even in
a capital accusation, a synod of their brethren were the sose judges of
their guilt or innocence. Such a tribunal, unless it was inflamed by
personal resentment or religious discord, might be favourable‚ or even

partial to the sacerdotal order: but Constantine was satisfied ¹¹², that
secret impunity would be less. pernicious than public seandal: and

¹0⁹ In Ariminense synodo super ecclefia-
rurn δι clericorum privilegiis tradat& habito,
usque eo dispofitio progreffa est, ut juga quae
viderentur ad ecelesiam pertinere, a publica
funciione cess‘arent inquietudine defistente:
quod nostra videtur dudum sanaio repulfisse.
Cod. Theod. l. xvi. tit. ii⁴ leg. ις. Had the
synod of Rimini carried this point, such prac-
tical merit might have atoned for some spe-
culative herefies.

¹¹0 From Eusebius (in Vit. Constant. Liv.
c. 27.) and Sozomen (Li c. 9.) we are assu—
red thax the episcopaljuril‘diflion was extend-
ed and confirmed by Constantine; but the
forgery of a famous ediet, which was never
fairly inserted in the Theodofian code (see
at the end, tom. vi. p. 303.)‚ is demonstrated
by Godefroy in the most satisfactory manner.
It is strange that M. de Montesquieu, who
was a lawyer as well as a philosopher, should
allege this edi& of Constantine (Esprit des
Loix, l. xxix. c. 16.) without intimating any
inspicior),

¹¹¹ The subjeci of ecclesiastica] jurisdifflon
has been involved in a mist of paffion, ofpre<
judice, and of interest. Two of the fairest
books which have fallen into my hands are
the Institutes of Canon Law, by the Abbe} de
Fleuny, and the Civil History of Naples, by
Giannone. Their moderatior: was the effe&
of situation as well as of temper. Fleury
was a French ecclefiastic, who respecied the
authority of the parliaments; Giannone was
an Italian lawyer‚ who dreaded the power of
the church. And here let me obscure, that
as the general propofitions which I advance
are the result of many particular and imper-
fe& faeis, I must either refer the reader to
those modern authors who have expressly treat-
ed the subjest, or swell these notes to a dis-
agreeable and disproportioned fize.
