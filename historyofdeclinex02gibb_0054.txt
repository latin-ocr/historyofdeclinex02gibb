THE DECLINE AND FALL

praefe&8‚ they were attentive to counterbalance the power of thim
great office by the uncertainty and ssiortness of its duration ¹0².

From their superior importance and dignsty, Rome and Constan-
tinople were alone excepted from the jurisdiction of the Praetoriarr
praefects. The immense fize of the city, and the experience of the
tardy, ineffectual operation of the laws, had furnished the policy of
Augustus with a specious pretence for introducing a neur magistrate,
who alone could restrain a servile and turbulent populace by the

¹03

strong arm of arbitrary power . Valerius Nleffalla was appointed

the first prccfe& of Rome, that his reputation might countenance so
invidious a measure: but, at the end of a few days, that accom-
plished citizen ¹0⁴ resigned his office, declax-ing with a spirit worthy
of the friend of Brutus, that he found himself incapable of exer-

. As the sense
of liberty became less exquisite, the advantages of order were more

cising a power incompatible with public freedom ¹0⁵

clearly understood3 and the praefecQ who seemed to have been de-
signed as a terror only to ssaves* and vagrants‚ was permitted to extend

¹⁰² For this, and the other dignities of
the empire, it may be sufficient to refer to
the ample commentaries of pancirolus and
Godesroy, who have diligently collefted and
accurately digested in their proper order all
the legal and historical materials. From
those authors, Dr. Howell (History of the
World, vol. ii. p. 24—77.) had deduced a
very distin& abridgment of the state of the
Roman empire-

Chron. p. 155- Dion Caffius, in the ora-
tion of Maecenas (l. vii. p. 675.), describes
the prerogatives of the praesc& of the city as
they were established in his own time.

¹0⁴ The same of Messalla has been scarcely
equal to his merit. In the earliest youth he
was recommended by Cicero to the friendssiip
of Brutus. He followed the standard of the

republic till it was broken in the fields off
Philippi : he then accepted and deserved the
favour of the most moderate of the conquera
ors; and unisormly ass'erted his freedom and.
dignity in the court of Augustus. The tri-
umph of Messalla was justified by the con-
questos Aquitain. As an orator, he disputed
the palm of eloquence with Cicero himself.
Messalla cultivated every muse, and was tha
patron of every man of genius. He spent
his evenings in philosophie conversation with
Horace3 assumed his place at table between
Delia and Tibullus ; and amused his leisure by
encouraging the poetica} talents of young
Ovid.

press'es the same idea, in other words: quali
