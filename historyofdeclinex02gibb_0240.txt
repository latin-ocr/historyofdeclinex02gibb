220 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ¹30?- P. the treasurers of the province are d-ireeted to pay into his hands the
k--v-...s sum of three thousand folles, or eighteen thousand pounds sterling,
and to obey his farther requisitions for the relief of the churches of
Africa, Numidia, and Mauritania ¹⁰³. The liberality of Constantine
encreased in a just proportion to his saith, and to his vices. He as-
figned in each city a regular allowance of corn, to supply the fund
of *ecclefiastical charity3 and the persons ¹of both sexes who em-

braced the monastic life, became the peculiar favour-ites of their
sovereign. The Christian temples of Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusa-
lem, Constantinople, δίς. displayed the ostentatious piety of a prince,
ambitious in a declining age to equal the perse& labours of anti-
quity¹⁰⁴. The form of these religious edifices was simple and
oblong5 though they might sometimes swell into the shape of a
dome, and sometimes branch into the figure of a c-ross. The tim-
bers were framed for the most part of -cedars of Libanu33 the roof
was covered with tiles, perhaps of gilt brass3 and the walls, the co—
lumns, the pavement‚ were incrusted with variegated marbles. The
most precious ornaments of gold and iilver, of filk and gems, were
profusely dedicated to the service of the altar3 and this specious
magnificence was supported on the solid and· perpetual bafis of
«lauded property. In the space of two centuries‚ from the reign of
Constantine to that of Justinian‚ the eighteen hundred churches of
the empire were enriched by the frequent and unalienable gifts of
the prince and people. An annual income of fix hundred pounds
sterling may be reasonably affigned to the biihops, who were placed
