exceed the number of twenty thousand persons ¹³¹. Frbm this fact,
and from similar· examples, there is reason to believe, that the
constitution of the legionary troops, to which they partly owed
their valour and discipline, was diffolved by Constantine; ancl
that the bands of Roman infantry, which still assumed the same
names and the same honours, consisted only of one thousand or fifteen
hundred men ¹³². The conspiracy of so many separate detachments,
each of which was awed by the sense of its own weakness, could
easily be checked3 and the succe-{sors of Constantine might indulge
their love of ostentation, by iffuing their orders to one hundred and
thirty-two legions, inscribed on the muster—roll of their numerous
armies. The remainder of their troops was distributed into several
*hundred cohorts of infantry, and squadrons of cavalry. Their arms,
and titles, and enslgns, were calculated to inspire terror, and to dis-
