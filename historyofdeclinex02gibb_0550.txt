530 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {xis P· ject, every desperate exile, might entermin a rcaszmable hope of
ι-γ-ζ-ι subverting thc weak and distracto} govcrnmcnt of Britain. The
hostile tribes of the North, who detestcd the pride and power of the
King of the World, suspended their dmmstie feuds 3 and the Bar-
barians of the land and sca, the Scets, the Piens, and the Saxone,
spread themselves, with rapid and isi-essssttble fury, from the wall of
Antoninus to the shores of livent. Every productim] of art and
nature, every object of convenience or luxury, which they were
incapable of creating by Libo-nt, or proctiring by trade, was accu-

sopher may deplore the eternal discord of the human race, but he
will confess, that the delire of spoil is a more rational provocation
than the vanity of conquest. From the age of Constantine to that,

of Valentinian, are accused, by an eye—witness, of delighting in
the taste of human flesh. WVhen they hunted the woods„ for prey,
