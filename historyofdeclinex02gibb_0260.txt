might plcasc, but could not satisfy, a rational mind. A prophet, or
apostle, inspired by the Deity, can alone exercisc a '‘twful dominion
over 1116 faith of mankind; and the theology of Plato might have
been sor ever eonfounded with the philosophica] vifions of the Aca-
‹lc1ny‚ the Porch, and the Lycoeum, if the name and divine attributes
of the Logos 111111 1101 been confirmed by the celestial pen of the last
and most sublime of the Evangelil‘ts20. The Christian Revelatimi,
which was consummated under the reign of Nerva, disclosed to the
world the amazing secret, that the LOGOS, who was with God from
the beginning, and was God, who had made all things, and for
whom all things had been made, was incarnate in the person of Jesus
of Nazareth3 who had been born of a virgin, and suffered death on
the cross. Belides the general design of fixing on a perpetual bafis
the divine honours of Christ, the most ancient and respectable of the

²⁰ The Platonists admired the beginning
of the Gospel of St. John, as containing an
exa& transcript of their own principles, Au-
gustin. de civitat. Dei, x. 29. Amelius apud
Cyril. advers. Julian. 1. viii. p. 283. But
in the third and fourth centuries‚ the Plato-

nists of Alexandria might improve their Tri-

nity, by the secret study of the Christian

theology.

²¹· The sentiments of the Ebionites are
fairly stated by Molheim (p.331.) and Le
Clerc (Hist. Eccles. p. 535.). The Cle-
menfines, publilhed among the apostolical
fathers, are attributed by the critics to one
of these sestarief.

²³ Staunch polemics, like Bull (Judicium
Eccles. Cathol. c. 2.), insist on the orthodoxy
of the Nazarenes; which appears less pure
and certain in the eyes of Molheim (p.

3 30.),
