OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

ssantine himself in his sacred consistory, were all favourable to the
cause of Caeciliam and he was unanimoussy acknowledged by the
civil and ecclesiastical powers, as the true and lawful primate of
Africa. The honours and estates of the church were attributed to
his suffragan bissnops, and it was not without difficulty, that Con-
