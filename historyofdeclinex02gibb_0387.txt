condireted him, by their infallible wisdom‚ in every affion of his w-a

l·ife; and that he had¹ acquired such an intimate knowledge of his

his hair; that they warned hirn of every impending danger, and C

heavenly g'uests, as readily to distiriguish the voice of Jupiter from
that of Minerva, and the form of Apollo from the figure of Her--
cules ²⁶. These sseeping 01· waking vilioris, the ordinary effeecs of
abstinence and fanaticism, would almost degrade the emperor to the
level· of an Egyptian monk. But the useless lives of Antony or
Pachomius were consumed in these vain occupations. Julian could
break from the dream of superstition to arm himself for battle3 and
after vanquishing in the field the enemies of Rome, he calmly retired
into his tent, to dietate the wise and salutary laws of an empire, or

fondly expe&ed the cure of every evil, and the restoration of
every blessing3 and instead of dis-approving of the ardour of their
pious wishes, Julian ingenuoussy confeffed‚ that he was ambitious
to attain a situation, in which he might be useful to his country, and

to his religion. But this religion was viewed with an hostile eye

²⁶ Julian's modesty confined him to obscure secret apostacy of his brother; and in a let-
and occafional hints; but Libanius expatiaten ter, which may be received as genuine, he
with pleasure on the fasts and vifions of the exhorts Julian to adhere to the religion of
religious hero (Legat. ad Julian. p. 157· and their ancestors; an argument, which, as it
Orat. Parental. c. lxxxiii. p. 309, 310.). should seem, was not yet perfeffly ripe. See

234. Gallus had some reason to snspe& the ii. p. 141.
