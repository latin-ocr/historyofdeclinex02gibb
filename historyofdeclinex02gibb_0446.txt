&ww-„a might detach an army 'of four thousand horse, and twenty thousand
foot‚ to the assistance of the Romans³⁷. But the fe'eble Arsaces
Tiranus ³³, king of Armenia, had degenerated still more shamefully

Armenia, who, without exposing the safety of his own dominionS,

than his father chosroes, from the manly virtues of the great'Ti- ,
ridates ς and as the pusillanimous monarch was averse to any enter-¹
prizc of danger and glory, he could· disguise his tiinid indolence ῃ
by the more decent excuses of religion and gratitude. He ex-
pressed a pious attachment to the memory of Constantius, froni ὁ
whose hands he had received in marriage Olympias, the daugh-
ter of the praefect Ablavius3 and the alliance of a female, who had
been educated? as the destined wife of the emperor Constans, exalted
the dignity of a Barbarian king ³⁹. Tiranus profeffed the Christian
religion ; he reigned over a nation of Christian83 and he was re-
strained‚ by every principle of conscience and interest, from contri-
buting to the victory, which would consummate the ruin of the
church. The alienated mind of Tiranus was exasperated by the
indiscretion of Julian, who treated the king of Armenia as his
ssave, and as the enemy of the gods. The haughty and threatening
style of the Imperial mandates ⁴⁰ awakened the secret indignation of a
Princo, who, in the humiliating state of dependence, was still con·
scions of his royal descent from the Arsacides, the lords of the East,

and the rivals of the Roman power.

supplied Marc Antony with 16‚ooo horse, a Christian,

armed and disciplined aster the Parthian
manner (Plutarch, in M. Antonio, torn. v.
p. ¹¹7-)- . .

iii. c. ιι. p. 242.) fixes his accession (A. D.
354.) to the 17th year of Constantius.
“ ³⁹ Ammian. xx.. 11. Athanasius (tom. i.

p. 856.) says, in general term, that Con-

40 Ammianus (xxiii. 2.) uses a word much
too soft for the occafion, monuerat. Mura-
tori (Fabricius, Bibliothec. Graec. tom. vii.
p. 86.) has published an epistle from Julian to
the satrap Arsaces; fieree, vulgar, and (though

it might deceive sozomen, l. vi. c. ς.), most ,

probably spurious. La Bleterie (Hist. de Jo-
vier„ tom. ii. p. 339.) transsates and rejefts it.
