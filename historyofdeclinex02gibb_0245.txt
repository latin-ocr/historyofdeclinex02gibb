He vanquiffied the monster of Libya,
the president Andronicus, who abused the authority of a venal office,
invented new modes of rapine and torture, and aggravated the

guilt of oppreffion by that of sacrilege ¹²⁰. After a fruitless attempt

to reclaim the haughty magistrate by mild and religious admonition,
Synefius proceeds to inflict the last sentence of ecclefiastital justice ¹²¹,
which devotes Andronicus, with his affociates and their families,
‘to the abhorrence of earth and heaven. The impenitent smners,
more cruel than Phalaris or Sennacherib, more destruitive than war,
pestilence, or a cloud of locusts, are deprived of the name and privi-
leges of Christians, of the participation of the sacraments, and of the
hope of Paradise. The bilhop exhorts the clergy, the magistrates,

and the people, to renounce all society with the enemies of Christ5

dronicus was illegal; since he was a native

and the lips of the victims.

expreffed in a rhetorical style. (Synefius,
Epist. lviii. p. 201—203.) The method of
involving whole families, though somewhat
unj nst, was improved into national interdists.
