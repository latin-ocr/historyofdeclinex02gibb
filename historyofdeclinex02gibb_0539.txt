both flanks by Jovinus and Severus, the two masters-general of the
cavalry and infantry of the West. The Alemanni, unable to prevent
the devastation of their villages, fixed their camp on a lofiy, and
almost inacceffible, mountain, in the modern duchy of Vv'irtem—
berg, and resolutely expected the approach of the Romans. The
life of Valentinian was exposed to imminent danger, by the intrepid
curiosity with which he persisted to explore some secret and unm
guarded path. A troop of Barbarians suddenly rose from their am·-
buscade: and the emperor, who vigoroussy spurred his horse down

a steep and ssippery descent, was obliged to leave behind him his>

armour-bearer‚ and his helmet, magnificently enriched with gold and

precious stones. At the signal of the general affault, the Roman‘

troops encompaffed and ascended the mountain of Solicinium on three

from the most distant tribes of the North ⁹⁴. The banks of the
