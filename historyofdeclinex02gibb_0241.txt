l'pecifies some homes, sh0p3, gardeyne, and fai-ms, which belonged to
the three Bcfilicae of Rome, St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. John Lateran,
in the provinces of Italy, Africa, and the East. They produce, be-
fides a reserved rent of oil, linen, paper, aromaties, &Q a clear
annual revenue of twenty-two thousand pieces of gold, er* twelv'e
thousand pounds sterling. In the age of Constantine and Jtistinian,
the bishops no longer possessed, perhaps they nowlongerddelerved,
the unsuspeeting confidence of their clergy and people. nThe eccle-

sxastical revenues of each diocese were divided into foun' parts; for ’

revenue of the patriarchs, and the most weal-
1hy bilhops, is not express'ed; the highest an-
nual valuation of a bilhopric is stated at
thirty, and the lowest at mco, pounds of gold ;
the medium might be taken at fixtecn, but
these valuations are much below the real va-
lue.

¹0⁶ See Batonius (Annal. Eccles. A. D. 324,
ΝΟ. 53. 65. 70, 71.). Every record which

comes from the Vatican is justly suspessed3 “

yet these rent-rolls have an ancient and au-

thentic colour3 and it is at least evidem, that,

if* forged, they were forged in a period when
farms, not kingdom, were the objefts of pa-
pal avarice.

The legal divifion of the ecclesiastical rcvenue
does not appear to have been established in

the time of Ambrose and Chrysostom. Simu
plicius and Gelafius, who were bilhops of
Rome in the latter part of the fifth century,
mention it in their pastoral letters as a gene-
ral law, which was already confirmed by the
custom of Italy⁴

¹⁰⁸ Ambrose, the most strenuous afferter of
ecclesiastica} privileges, submits without a
murmur to the payment of the land-tax.
“ Si tributum petit imperator, non negamus ς
agri ecclefiae solvunt tributum; solvimus
“ quae sunt Caesaris Caesari, δε qua: sunt Dei
“ Deo: tributum Caesaris est ; non negatur.’'
Bamnius labours to interpret this tribute as
as an a& of charity rather than of duty (An-
nal. Eccles. A. D. 387.); but the words, if
not the intendens, of Ambrose, are more
candidly explained by Thomassin, Discipline
de I’Eglise, tom. iii. l. i. c. 34. p. zos.
