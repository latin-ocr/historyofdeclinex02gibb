OF THE ROMAN EMmE, 473 .

Amida3 and that rising city, with tls& reinforcement of a very con- C {Ixssff

siderable colony, soon recovered its former splendour‚ and became h--v-—J
the capital of Mesopotamia ¹²⁶. Similar orders were dllpatched by
the emperor for-the evacuation of Singara and the castle of the Moors;
and for the restitution of the five provinces beyond the Tigris. Sapor
enjoyed the glory and the fruita of his victory3 and this ignomi-
nious peace has justly been considered as a memorable aera in the
decline and fall of the Roman empire. The'predeceffors of Jovian
had sometimes relinqnii‘hed the dominion of distant and unprofitablc
provinces: but, fince the foundation of the city, the genius of
Rome, the god Terminua⁷ who guarded the boundaries of the re·-
public‚ had never retired before the sword ofa victorious enemy ¹²⁷.

After Jovian had performed those engagements, which the voice of ffffgfflssffi
his people might have tempted him to violate, he hassened away from '¹ ἲ
the scene of his disgrace, and proceeded with his whole court to enjoy
the luxury of Antioch ¹¹⁸. without consulting the dientes of religious
zeal‚ he was prompted by humanity and gratitmle, to bestow the
last honours on the remains of his deceased sovereign ¹²⁹: and Proco-
pius, who smeerely bewailed the loss of his kinsman, was removed
from the command of the army, under the decent pretence of con-
duffing the funeral. The corpse of Julian was transported from
Nifibis'to Tarsus, in a ssow march of fifteen days3 and, as it paffed
through the cities of the East, was saluted by the hostile factions,

with mournful lamentations and clamorous insults. The Pagans al-
