OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

tracted the criminal engagement3 and their future perseverance in
the worship of the gods was enforced by every consideration of duty
and of interest. By the frequent repetition of these arts‚ and at the
expence of sums which would have purchased the service of half the
nations of Scythia, Julian gradually acquired for his troops the ima—
ginary prote&ion of the gods, and for himself the firm and effeetual
support of the Roman legions⁵³. It is indeed more than probable‚
that the restoration and encouragement of Paganism revealed a mul-
titude of pretended Christians, who, from motives of temporal ad-
vantage, had aequiesced in the religion of the former reign3 and
who afterwards returned, with the same flexibility of conscience, to
the faith which was profess'ed by the successbrs of Julian.

While the devout monarch ineeffantly laboured to restore and
propagate the religion of his ancestors, he embraced the extraor-
dinary defign of rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem. In a public
epistle ⁵⁴ to the nation or eommunity of the Jews, dispersed through
the provinces, he pities their missortunes, condemns their oppres-
sors, praises their constancy, declares himself their graeious protec-
tor, and expresses a pious hope, that after his return from the
Persian war, he may be permitted to pay his grateful vows to the
Almighty in his holy city of Jerusalem. The blind superstition, and
abje& ssavery, of those unfortunate exiles, must excite the contempt
of a philosophie emper0r3 but they deserved the friendship of Julian,
by their implacable hatred of the Christian name. The barren syna-
gogue abhorred and envied the fecundity of the rebellious church:
