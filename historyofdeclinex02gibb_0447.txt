OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE

The military dispositions of Julian were skilfully contrived to
deceive the spies, and to divcrt the attention, of Sapor. The legions
appeared to dire& their march towards Nisibis and the Tigris. On
a sudden they wheeled to the right3 traversed the level and naked
plain of Carrhae3 and reached, on the third day, the banks of the
'‘Euphrates, where the strong town of Nicephorium, or Callinicum,
had been founded hythe Macedonian kings. From thence the emm
peror pursued his march, above ninety miles, along the winding

stream of the Euphrates, till, at length, about one month after his
γ departure from Antioch, he discovered the towers of Circesium, the
extreme limit of the Roman ‹lotni11ions. The army of Julian, the
most numerous that· any of the Caesars had ever led against Persia,
consisted of sixty-five thousand effeffive and·well-disciplincd soldiers„
The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry, of Romans and Barba-
rians, had been selected from the different provinces; and a just pre-⁶
eminence of loyalty and valour was claimed by the hardy Gauls,
who fguarded the throne and person of their beloved prince. A
’ formidable body of Scythian auxiliaries had been transported from
another climate, and almost from another world, to invade a distant
country, of whose name and situation they were ignorant. The
loye of rapine and war allured to the Imperial standard several tribes
of Saracens, or roving Arabs, whose service Julian had commanded,
while he sternly refused the payment of the accustomed sublidies.
The broad charmel of the Euphrates ⁴¹ was crowded by a fieet of
eleven hundred ships, destined to attend the motions, and to latist'y
the wants, of the Roman· army. The military strength of the fleet

was composed of fifty armed gallies; and these were accompanied
