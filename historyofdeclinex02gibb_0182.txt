arts of war and governinent3 and when he awkwardly repeated
some military exercife Which it was neceffiiryrrfor him to leam, he
exclaimed with a figh, “ O Plato, Plato, what a task for a philoso-'

bufiness are too apt to despise, had filled the mind of Julian with

him with the love of virtue, the defu-e of fame, and the contempt of
death. The habits of temperance recommendcd in the schools, are
still more effential in the severe discipline of a camp. The fimple
wants of nature regulated the measure of his food and sseep. Re- ’
jecting with disdain the delicacies provided for his table, he satisfied
his appetite with the coarse and common fare which was allotted to
the meanest soldiers. During the rigour of a Gallie winter, he never
suffered a fire in his bed-chamber3 and after a {hort and interrupted
ssumber, 116 frequently rose in the middle of the night from a carpet
spread on the floor, to dispatch any urgent businesS, to visit his munda,

on fancied topics of declamation, were more usefully applied to
excite or to affuage the passions of an armed‘multitude: and although
Julian, fre-m his early habits of conversation and literature, was
more famili-arly acquainted with the beauties of the Greek language,
