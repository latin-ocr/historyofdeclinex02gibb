or THE RoMAN EMPIRE.

’ {rain of faithful followers‚ he desei-ted to the Imperial camp3 ex-
posed, in a specious tale, the injuries which he had sustained3 exag-
gerated the cruelty of Sapor, the discontent of the people, and the
weakness of the monarchy‚ and confidently offered himself as the-

hostage and guide of the Roman march. The most rational grounds
of suspicion were urged, without effest, by the wisdom and expe-
rience of ⁷ Hormisdas; and the credulous Julian, receiving the traitor
into his bosom, was persuaded to iffue an hasty order, which, in the
opinion of mankind, appeared to arraign his prudence, and to en-
danger his safety. He destroyed, in a fingle hour, the whole navy,
which had been transported above five hundred miles, at so great an
expence of toil, of treasure, and of blood. Twelve, or, at the most,
twenty-two, small vess'els were saved, to accompany, on carriages,
the march of the army, and to form occafional bridges for the
paffage of the rivers. A supply of twenty days provisions was re-
served for the use of the soldiers 3 and the rest of the magazines, with
a ficet of eleven hundred vessels, which rode at anchor in the Tigris,
were abandoned to the flames, by the absolute command of the
emperor. The Christian bishops, Gregory and Augustin, insult the
madness of the apostate, who executed, with his own hands, the
sentence of divine justice. Their authority, of less weight, perhaps,
in a military question, is confirmed by the cool judgment of an ex-

perienced soldier, who was himself spefitator of the conflagration‚

and who could not disapprove the reluctant murmurs of the troops ⁷³·
