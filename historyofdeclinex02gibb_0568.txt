THE DECLINE AND FALL

He then marched against the Venedi3 unskilled in the use of'arms,
and formidable only by their numbers, which filled the wide extent
os the plains of modern Poland. The victorious Goths, who were
not inferior in numbers, prevailcd in the contest, by the clecifive
advantages of exercise and discipline. After the submiffion of the Ἰ
Venedi, the conqueror advanced, without reslstance‚ as far as the
confines of the AEstii ¹⁴²3 an ancient people‚ whose name is still pre-
served in the province of Esthonia. Those distant inhabitants os the
Baltie coast were supported by the labours of agriculture, enriched by
the trade of arnber, and consecrated by the peculiar worship of the
Nlother of the Gods. But the scarcity of iron obliged the AEstian

warriors to content themselves with wooden clubs; and the redu&ion

'of that wealthy country is ascribed to the pmdence, rather than tt)

the arms, of Hermanric. His dominions, which extended from the⁴
Danube to the Bal'tic, included the native secus, and the recent ac-
qu‘ifitions, of the Goths; and he reigned over the greatest part (ff
Germany and Scythia with the authori-ty of a conqueror, and some—
times with the cruelty of a tyrant. But he reigned over a part of
the globe incapable of perpetuating and adorning the glory of its
heroes. The name of Hermanric is almost buried in oblivion'; his
exploits are imperfedlly known3 and the Romans themselves ap-
peared uneonscious of the progress of an aspiring power, which
threatened the liberty of the North, and the peace of the empire¹⁴³m

perial house of Constantine, of whose power and liberality they had
received so many signal proofs, They respect-ed* the public· peace ;.-
