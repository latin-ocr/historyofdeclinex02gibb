THE DECLINE AND FALL

ments of Julian, as he expresses them with warmth and freedom in
a letter to one of his most intimate friends. After stating his own
conduct, he proceeds in the following ternis: “ lVas it poffible for
“ the disciple of Plato and Aristotle to a& otherwise than Ι have
“ done? Could I abandon the unhappy subjeels entrusted to my

“ care? Was Ι not called upon to defend them from the repeated

“ injuries of these unfeeling robbers? A tribune who deserts his

“ post is punissied with death, and deprived of the honours of bu-
“ rial. With what justice could I pronounce his sentence, if, in the
“ hour of danger, I myself neglected a duty far more sacred and
“ far more important? God has placed me in this elevated p0st3 his
“ providence will guard and support me. Should Ι 1)6 condemned
“ to suffer, I shall derive comfort from the testimony of a pure and .
“ upright conscience. Would to heaven, that Ι ‘still possessed a
“ counsellor like Sallust! If they think proper to send me a successor,
“ Ι shall submit without reluctance 3 and had much rather improve

“ the short opportunity of doing good, than enjoy a long and lasting

“ impunity of evil ⁹ff.” The precarious and dependent situation of

Julian displayed his virtues, and concealed his defeets. The young
hero who supported, in Gaul, the throne of Constantius, was not
permitted to reform the vices of the government3 but he had cou-
rage to alle‘viate or to pity the distress of the people. Unless he had
been able to revive the martial spirit of the Romans, or to introduco
the arts of industry and refinement among their savage enemies, he
could not entertain any rational hopes of securing the public tran-
qtiillity, either by the peace or conquest os Germany. Yet the
victories of Julian suspended, for a short time, the inroads of the
Barbarians, and delayed the ruin of the VVestern Empire.
