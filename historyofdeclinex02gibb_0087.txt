Ι. It is obvious, that, as long as the immutable constitution
of human nature produces and maintains so unequal a division
of property, the most numerous part of the community would
be deprived of their subfistence, by the equal affeffment of a tax
from which the sovereign would derive a very triHing revenue·
Such indeed might be the theory of the Roman capitation3 but in
the praefice, this unjust equality was no longer felt, as the tribute
was collected on the principle of a real, not of a perstnal impofition.
Several indigent citizens contributed to compose a single head, or
ssmre of taxat10n3 while the wealthy provincial, in proportion to his
fortune, alone represented several of those imaginary beings. In a
poetical request, addreffed to one of the last and most deserving of the
Roman Princes who reigned in Gaul, Sidonius Apollinaris personi-
fies his tribute under the figure of a triple monster, the Geryon of
the Grecian fables‚ and intreats the new Hercules that he would
most gracioussy be pleased to save his life by cutting off three of hiz
headsffl. The fortune of Sidonius far exceeded the customary
wealth of a poet3 but if he had pursued the allufion, he must have
painted many of the Gallie nobles with the hundred heads of the
deadly,Hydra, spreading over the face of the country, and devour-
ing the substance of an hundred families. II. The difficulty of
allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds sterling, even for the
average of the capitation of Gaul, may be rendered more evident
