THE DECLINE AND FALL

By chastismg the pride of the Goths, and by accepting the ho-
mage of a suppliant nation, Constantine asserted -the majesty of the
Roman empire3 and the ambafl'adors of AEthiopia, Pei-fia, and
the most remote countries of India, congratulated the peace and
prosperity of his government ⁴⁶. If he rcckoned, among the
favours of fortune, the death of his eldest son, of his nephew,
and perhaps of his wife, he enjoyed an uninterrupted How of
private as well as public fclicity, tili the thirtieth year of his
reign; a period which none of his predecess'ors, since Augustus,
had been permitted to celebrate. Constantine survived that so-
lemn festival‘about ten months; and, at the mature age of fixty-
four, after a short illness, he ended his memorable life at the
palace of Aquyrion, in the suburbs of Nicomedia, whither he
had retired for the benefit of the air, and with the hope of
recruiting his exhausted strength by the use of the vvarm baths.
The excessive demonstrations of grief, or at least of mourning,
surpaffed whatever had been practised on any former occaslon.
Notwithstanding the claims of the senate and people of ancient
Rome, the corpse of the deceased emperor, according to his last
request, was transported to the city, Which was destined to preserve
the name and memory of its founder. The body of Constantine,
adorned with the vain symbols of greatness, the purple and dia-
dem, was depofited on a golden bed in one of the apartments of the
palace, which for that purpose had been splendidly furnished and
