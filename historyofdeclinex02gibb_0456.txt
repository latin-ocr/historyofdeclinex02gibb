THE DECLINE AND FALL

thousand sive hundred persons, of both sexes, the fceble remnant of
a flourissiing people, were permitted to retire: the plentiful maga-
zines of corn, of arms, and of splendid fui-niture, were partly distri-
buted among the troops, and partly reserved for the public service:
the useless stores were destroyed by fire, or thrown into the stream
of the Euphrates 3 and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total
ruin of Perisabor.

Under the direffion of Nevitta and Dagalaiphus, thetrenches were
opened at a considerable distance, and gradually prolonged as far as
the edge of the ditch. The ditch was speedily filled with earth·,
