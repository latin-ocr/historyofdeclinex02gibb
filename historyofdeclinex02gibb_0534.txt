“ the honest Pagan, would those pontiffs consult their true happi--

Damasus and Ursinus was extinguissied by the exile of the latter34
and the wisdom of the praefe& Praetextatus ⁸⁶ restored the tranquil--

learning, of taste, and politeness-; who disguiseda a reproach in the*

form of a jest, when he affured Damasus, that if he could obtain
