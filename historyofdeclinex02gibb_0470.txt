'THE DEC'LI'NE' ‚AND FA‘LL·

Y'et there are not wanting some specious, and perhaps solid; rea*-
sons, which might justify the resolution of Julian. The navigation
of the Euphrates never ascended above Babylon, nor that of the·
Tigris above Opis ⁷⁹. The distance of the last—mentioned city from‘
the Roman camp was not very confiderable3 and Julian must soon
have renounced the vain and impracticable attempt of forcing up*
wards a great ficet against the stream of a rapid 1·iver⁸‘', which in
several places was embarraffed by natural οι· ειῑῑίίὶείειῑ cata1·a&s⁸¹.
The power of sails and oars was insufficient3 it became necessary
to tow the ships against the curarent of the river3 the strength of'
twenty thousand soldiers was exhausted in this tedious and servile*
labour3 and if the Romans continued to march along the banks, of ”
the Tigris, they could only expe& to return home without atchievr
ing any enterprize worthy of the genius or fortune of their leader..
If, on the contrary, it was adviseable to advance into the inland
country, the destruction of the fleet and magazines was the only
measure which could save that valuable prize from the hands os the ,
numerous and active troops which might suddenly be poured from
the gates of Ctesiphon. Had the arms of Julian been victorious, we
ssiould now admire the conduct, as well as the courage, of a hero„
who, by depriving his soldiers of the hopes of a retreat, left thern‘
only the alternative· of death or conquest δ”,

The cimber-some train of artiliery and waggons‚ which retards

the operations os a modern army, were in a great measure. unknown
