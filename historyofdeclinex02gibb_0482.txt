lifications which excite the admiration and cnvy of mankind, the
cornely person of Jovian‚ his cheerful temper, and familiar wit, had
gained the affection of his fellow-soldiers; and the generals of both
parties acquiesced in a popular electiori, which had not been con-

elevation was moderated by the just apprehenfion, that the same
day might terminate the life and reign of the new emperor.
The pressing voice of necessity was obeyed without delay3 and the
first orders iffued by Jovian, a few hours after his predecessor had

(Histoire de Jovien, tom. i. p. 1—238.) has
composed an elaborate history of his short
reign3 a work remarkably distinguissied by

elegance of style, critical disquisition, and
religious prejudice.
