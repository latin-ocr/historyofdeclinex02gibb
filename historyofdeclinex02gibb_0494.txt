THE DECLINE AND FALL

the soul of the apostate to hell, and his body to the grave ¹³⁰. One
party lamented the approaching ruin of their altars-5 the other ce·-
lebrated the marvellous deliverance of the clun-eh. The Christians
applauded, in lofty and ambiguous strains, the stroke of divine
vengeance, which had been so long suspended over the guilty head
of Julian. They acknowledged, that the death of the tyram, at
the instant he expired beyond the Tigris, was rcvealed to the
saints of Egypt, Syria, and Cappadocia ¹³¹ ; and, instead ef suffering,
him tO-fass by the Persian darts, their indiscretion ascribed ther
heroic deed to the obscure hand of some mortal or immortal
champion of the saith ¹³². Such imprudent declarations were
eagerly adopted by the malice‚ or credulity‚, of their adversaries ¹³³3
who darkly infinuated, or confidently asserted, that the go-
vernors os the church had instigated‘ and direered the fanaticism
of a domestic affaflin¹³⁴. Above sixteen years after the* death of

Julian, the charge was solemnly and vehemently urged? in a public

The Christian orator faintly mutters some ex-

he is well satisfied, that the real sufferbigs of

Julian will far exceed the fabulous tormenta
of Ixion (11· Tantalus. ’

saint or angel was obser-ved to be absent in

which a Jesuit might have transsated, is

prudently suppreffed by the president Cousin.

nece, mxi-ii. p. 162, 163.). It was urged,
as a decifive proof, that no Persian had ap-
peared to claim the promised reward (Liban.
Orat. Parent. c. 141. p. 363.). But the fly-
