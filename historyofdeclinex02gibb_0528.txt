THE DECLINE AND FALL

years. The death of Athanasius was the signal of the persecution of

..a Egypt3 and the Pagan minister of Valens, who forcibly seated the

worthless Lucius on the archiepiscopal throne, purchased the favour
of the reigning party by the blood and sufferings of their Christian

brethren. The free toleration of the heathcn and Jewish worship

was bitterly lamented, as a circumstance which aggravuted the mi-
sery of the catholics, and the guilt of the impious tyrant of the

East ⁶³.

The triumph of the orthodox party has left a deep stain of perse-
cution on the memory of Valens; and the charmes of a prince who
derived his virtues, as well as his vices, from a feeble understanding,
and a pufillanimous temper, scarcely deserves the labour of an apo-
logy. Yet candour may discover some reasons to suspe& that the
ecclefiastical ministers of Valens often exceeded the orders, or even
the intentions‚ of their master3 and that the real measure of facts
has been very liberally magnified by the vehement declamation
and easy credulity of his antagonists ⁶⁹. 1. The silence of Valen-
tinian may suggest a probable argument, that the partial severities,
Which were exercised in the name and provinces of his colleague,
amounted only to some obscure and inconsiderable deviations from
the established system of religious toleration ε and the judicious histo-
rian, who has praised the eqnal temper of the elder brother, has not-

thought himself obliged to contrast the tranquillity of the West

with the-cruel persecution of the East ⁷⁰. 2. VVhatever credit may

⁶⁸ This sketch of the ecclefiastical govern-
ment of Valens is drawn from Socrates
(l. im), Sozomen (l. vi.)‚ Theodorei (Lim),
and the immense compilations of Tillemont
(particularly tom. vi. viii. and ix.).

⁶⁹ Dr. Jortin (Remmks ou Ecclefiassical
Hffiory, vol. iv. p. 78.) lias already conceived
and intimated the same suspicion.

⁷⁰ This reflexion is so obvious and somme,

that Oi·ofius (l. vii. c. 32, 33.) delays the

persecution till after the death ofValentinian.>
Socrates, on the other hand, supposes (l. iii.

c. ξι), that it was appeased by a philosophi-

cal oration, which Themistius pronounced in-
the year 374 (Orat. xii. p. 154. in Latin on-

ly). Such contradic‘lions diminilh the evi-

dence, and reduce the term, of the persecu-

tion 'ot' valens.
