cautioussy delegated the powers of preaehing, harangued, without
the danger of interruptim] or reply, a submiffive multitude, whose
minds had been prepared and subdued by the awful ceremonies of
religion. Such was the striGt subordination of the catholic church,
that the same concerted sounds might iffue at once from an hundred
pulpits of Italy or Egypt, if they were remed ¹²⁴ by the master hand
off the Roman or Alexandrian primate. The defign of this institu—
tion was laudable, but the fruits were not always salutary. The
preachers recommended the praetice of the social duties; but they
exalted the perfee‘tion of monastic virtue, which is painful to the
individual and useless to mankind. Their charitable exhortations
betrayed a secret wish, that the clergy might be permitted to manage

the wealth of the faithful, for the benefit of the poor. The most ⁷

sublime representations of the attributes and laws of the Deity were
sullied by an idle mixture of metaphyfieal subtleties, puerile rites,
and fietitious miracles: and they expatiated, with the most fervent

zeal, on the religious merit of hating the adversaries, and obeying the
ministers, of the church. XVhen the public peace was distraCted by

heresy and schism, the sacred orators founded the trumpet, of distord

and, perhaps of sedition. The understandings of their congrega-
tions were perplexed by mystery, their paflions were inflamed by
invectives: and they russied from the Christian temples of Antioch
or Alexandria, prepared either to suffer or to infit& martyrdom.
