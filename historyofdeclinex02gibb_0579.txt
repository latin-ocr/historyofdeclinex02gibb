hundred miles, Valentinian :suddenly expired in the camp of Brege- C {Xe Ρ-

tio. The pastione, which had been so long stippreffed by the pre- k-v--J
sence of a master, immediately revived in the Imperial council ; and
the ambitious defign of reigning in the name of an infant, was art-
fully executed by Mellobaudes and ‘Equitiuz who commanded the
attachment of the Hlyrian and Italian hands. They contrived the
most honourable pretences to remove the popular leaders, and the
troops of Gaul, who might have asserted the claims of the lawful
succeffor: they suggested the nec-:Hity of extinguissiing the hopes of
foreign and domestic enemies, by a bold and decisive measure. The
empress Justina, who had been left in a palace about one hundred miles
from Bregedo, was rcspeetfully invited to appear in the camp, with
the son of the deceased emperor. On the fixth day after the death
of Valentinian‚ the infant prince of the same name, who was only·
four years old, was ssiewn, in the arms of his mother, to the legion83
and solemnly invested, by military acclamation, wjth the titles and
ensigns of supreme power. The impending dangers of a civil war
were seasonably prevented by the wife and moderate conduct of the
emperor Gratiam. He cheerfully accepted the choice of the ar1ny;
declared‚ that he should always consider the son of Justina as a
brother, not as a riva13 and advised the empress, with her son Va-
Ie-utinian, to fix their residence at Milan, in the fair and peaceful
province of Italy3 while he affumed the more arduous command of
the countries beyond the Alps. Gratiam differnbled his resentment .
. till he could safely punith, or disgmce, the authors of the conspiracy3
and though he uniformly behaved with tenderness and regard to his
infant colleague, he gradually confounded, in the administration of
the VVestern empire, the office of a guardian with the authority of a
sovereign. The government of the Roman world was exercised in

the united names of Valens and his two nephews3 but the feeble
