THE DECLINE AND FALL

stipulated, that all proecedings and all hostilities should be suspended
till the emperor's pleasure had been more distinctly ascertained. By
this seeming moderation, the Catholics were deceived into a salse and

fatal security3 while the legions of the Upper Egypt, and of Libya,
advanced, by secret orders and hasty marches, to beficge, or rather
to surprise, a capital, habituated to sedition, and inflamed by relig-ioue,
zeal ¹²⁹. The pofition of Alexandria, between the sea and the lake
Mareotis, facilitated the approach and landing of the troop83 who
were introduced into the heart of the city, before any efi'ectual mea-

days after the signature of the treaty, Syrianus duke of Egypt, at
the head of five thousand soldiers, armed and prepared for an affaust,
[inexpeetedly invested the church of St. Theonas, where the arch-
bishop, with a part of his clergy and people, performed their noc-

impetuosity of the attack, which was accompanied with every horrid

and the fragments of military weapons, rexnained the next day an
unexceptionable evidence in the poffeffion of the Catholics, the en-
terprise of Syrianus may be considered as a successful irrupfion,
rather than as an absolute conquest. The other churches of the city
were profaned by fimilar outrage83 and, during at least four months,
Alexandria was exposed to the insults of a licentious army, stimu-

were killed; who may deserve the name of martyrs‚ if their deatns
were neither provoked nor revenged3 bishops and presbyters were
treated with cruel ignominy3 consecrated virgins were stripped naked,
