The coarse and undistinguifhing pencil of Ammianus has delineated
his bloody figures with tedious and disgusting accuracy. But as
our attention is no longer engaged by the contrast of freedom and
servimde, of recent greatness and of aetual misery, we should turn
with horror from the frequent executiones, which disgraced‚ both
at Rome and Antioch, the reign of the two brothers ⁵³.
was of a timid ⁵⁴, and Valentinian of a choleric, dispofition⁵⁵. An
anxious regard to his personal safety was the ruling principle of
the administration of Valens. In the condition of a subject, he
had kiffed, with trembling avve, the hand of the oppreffor: and
when he ascended the throne, he reasonably expedffd, that the same
fears, which had subdued his own mind, would secure the patient
submiffion of his people. The favourites of Valens obtained, by

the privilege of rapine and confiscation, the wealth which his oeco-

⁵4 The younger Victor aliens, that he was
valde timidus : yet he behaved, as almost
every man would do, with decent resolution
at the head of an army. The same historian
attempts to prove, that his anger was harm-
less. Ammianus observes, with more candour

and judgment‚ incidentia crimina ad con—
temptam vel laesam principis amplitudinem
trahens, in sanguinem saeviebat.

rice from Valens to his servants. Avarice
more properly belongs to ministers than to
kings; in whom that paliion is commonly
extinguissied by absolute poffeffion.
