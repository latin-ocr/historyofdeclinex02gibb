The windi'ng channe} through which the waters os the Euxine
fiovv with a rapid and incessant course towards the lnlediterranean,
received the appellation of Bosphorus, a name not less celebrated in
the history, than in the fables, of antiquity ³. A crowd of temples
and of votive altars, profusely scattered along its steep and woody
banks, attested the unskilfulness, the terrors‚ and the devotion of the
Grecian navigators, who, after the example of the Argonauts, ex-

defied the son of Leda to the combat of the Cestus ⁵. The‘streights

described by Dionysius of Byzantium, who
lived in the time of Domitian (Hudson Geo-
graph. Minor. tom. iiL), and by Gilles or
Gyllius, a Freuch traveller of the XVIth
century. Tournefort (Lem-e XV.) seems to

Gyllius.

tom. i. p. 248.), who supposes that thc har-

⁵ The refidence of Amycus was in Afia,
between the old and the new castles, at a
place calledLaurus Infanti. That of Phi-
neus was in Europe, near the village ofMau-
romole and the Black Sca. See Gyllius de

pointed rocks, alternately covered and aban—
