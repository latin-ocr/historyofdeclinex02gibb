THE DECLINE AND> FALL

of Artogerass'a, by a bold and well-concerted sally of ¹the besieged.
But the forces of Sapor were continually renewed and increased;
the hopeless courage of the garrison was exhausted 3 the strength of .
the walls yielded to the afl'ault3 and the proud conqueror, after
wasting the rebellious city with fire and sword, led away cap-
t'rve an unfortunate queen3 who, in a more auspicious hour, had
been the destined bride of the son of Constantine ¹³⁵. Yet if Sapor
already triumphed in the easy conquest of two dependent kingdoms,
he soon felt, that a country is unsubdued, as long as the minds of
the people are actuated by an hostile and contumacious spirit. The
satraps, whom he was obliged to trust, embraced the first opportu-
nity of regzzining the affeciion of their conntrymen, and of signa-

version of the Armenians and Iberians, those nations confidered
the Christians as the favourites, and the Magians as the adversa-
ries, of the Supreme Being; the influence of the clergy, over a
superstitious people‚ was uniformly exerted in the cause of R0me3
and trs long as the sueceffors of Constantine disputed with those of
Artaxerxes the sovereignty of the intermediam provinces, the reli-
gious connexion always threw a decifive advantage into the scale of
the empire. A numerous and active party acknowledged Para, the
son of Tiranus, as the lawful sovereign of Armenia ; and his title to
the throne was deeply rooted in the hereditary succcllion of five
hundred years. By the unanimous consent of the Iber-iaus, the
country was equally divided between the rival princes3 and Aspa—
cures, who owed his diadem to the choice of Sapor, was obliged to
(leclare, that his regar-d for his children, who were detained as hostages
by the tyram, was the only consideration, which prevented him from
openly renouncing the alliance of Perlia. The emperor Valens, who
