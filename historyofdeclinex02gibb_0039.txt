OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

He divided Constantinople into fourteen regions or quarters ⁶⁶, dig-
nified the public council with the appellation of Senate ⁶¹, commu-
nicated to the citizens the privileges of Italy ⁶², and bestowed
on the rifing city the title of Colony, the first and most favoured

daughter of ancient Rome. The venerable parent still maintained

the legal and acknovvledged supremacy, which was due to her age„

to her dignity‚ and to the remembrance of her former greatness ⁶³.

As Constantine urged the progress of the work with the impa-
tience of a lover, the walls, the porficoes, and the principal edifices

were completed in a few years, or, according to another account,
in a few months ⁶⁴: but this extraordinary diligence should excite the

⁶0 The regions of Constantinople are men-
tioned in the code of justinian, and particu-
larly described in the Notitia of the younger
Theodofius; bui as the four last of them are
not included within the wall of Constantine,
it may be doubeti whether this division of
the city should be referred to the founder.

senators of old Rome were stiled Clariffi‘mi.

Marcellin. xxii. 9. From the eleventh epi-
stle of Julian, it ffiould seem that the place
of senator was considered as a burthen, rather
than as an honour: but the Abbe de la
Bletterie (Vie de Jovien, tom. ii. p. 37¹·)
has shewn that this epistle could not relate to
Constantinople. Might we not read, instead
of the celebrated name of Βυξωτηις, the ob-
scure but more probable word mmmmm?

⁶³ Julian (Orat. i. p. 8.) celebrates Con-
stantinople as not less superior to all other
cities, than {he was inferior to Rome itself.
His learned commentator (Spanheim, p. 75,
76.) justifies this language by several parallel
and contemporary instances.

after the division of the empire between the
two sons of Theodosius, which establilhed a
perse& equality between the old and the
new capital.
⁶⁴ Codinus (Antiquitat. p. 8.) astirms, that
the foundations of Constantinople were laid
in the year of the world 5837 (A. D. 329),
on the z6th of September, and that the city
was dedicated the uth of May 5838 (A. D.
330). He connects these dates with several
characteristic epochs‚ but they contradi& each
other3 the authority of Codinus is of little
weight, and the space which he affigns must
appear insufficient. The term of ten years
is given us by Julian (Orat. i. p. SA, and
Spanheim labours to establissi the truth of it
(p. 69-7ς), by the help of two paffiges
from Themistius (Orat. iv. p. 53.) and Pht.
