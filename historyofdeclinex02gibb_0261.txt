OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE

jesus as the greatest of the prophets, endowed with supernatural vir-
tue and power. They ascribed to his person and to his future reign
all the predictions of the Hebrew eracles which relate to the spiritual
and everlasting kingdom of the promised Meffiah ²⁴. Some of them
might confess that he was born of a virgin3 but they obstinately re-
je&ed the preceding existence and divine perfectioris of the L0g0s‚ or
Son of G0d‚ which are so clearly defined in the Gospel of St. John.
About fifty years afterwards, the Ebionites‚ whose errors are men—
tioned by Justin Martyr with less severity than they seem to de-
serve ²⁵, formed a very inconfiderable portion of the Christian name.
II. The Gnostics, who were distinguished by the epithet of Βοκίας,
deviated into the contrary extreme; and betrayed the human, while
they asserted the divine, nature of Christ. Educated in the school
of Plato, accustomed to the sublime idea of the Legem, they readily
conceived that the brightest AEon, or Emanation of the Deity‚ might
affume the outward shape and visible appearances of a moi-tal ²⁶3 but
they vainly pretended, that the imperfectione: of matter are incom-
patible with the purity of a celestial substance. While the blood of
Christ yet smoked on Mount Calvary, the Docetes invented the
impious and extravagant hypothesis, that, instead of iffuing from the
womb of the Virgin ²⁷, he had descendcd on the banks of the Jordan

²4 The humble condition and sufferings of
Jesus have always been a stumbling—block to
the Jews. “ Deus . . . contrariis coloribus
“ Meffiam depinxerat; futurus erat Rex5
“ Judex, Pastor,'’ δίε. See Limborch et
Orobio Amica Collat. p. 8. ¹9· 53—76. 192
-234. But this objection has obliged the
believing Christians to lift up their eyes to a
spiritual ancl everlasting kingdom.

p. 143, 144. See Le Clerc, Hist. Eccles.
p. 615. Bull, and his editor Grabe (Judi-
cium Eccles. Cathol. c. 7. and Appendix),
attempt to distort either the sentiments or the
words of Justin; but their violent correftion

editors.

²⁶ The Arians reproached the orthodox
party with bo'rrowing their Trinity from the
Valentinians and Marcionites. See Beau-
sobre, Hist. du Manicheisme‚ l. iii. c. ς. 7.

²⁷ Non dignum est ex utero credere Deum,
et Deum Christum . . . . non dignum est ut
tanta majestas per sordes et squalores mulie-
ris transire credatur. The Gnostics asserted
the impurity of matter, and of marriage;
and they were scandalized by the gross inter-
pretations of the fathers, and even of Au-
gustin himself. See Beausobre‚ tom. ii.
