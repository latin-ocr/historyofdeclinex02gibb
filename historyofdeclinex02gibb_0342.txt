approved discretion and fidelity. But he reserves for himself the
nominatior] of his other civil and military officers, with the troops,
the revenue, and the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps.
He admonilhes the emperor to consult the dictates of justice; to-
distrust the arts of those venal flatterers, who subfist only by the dis-
cord of princes; and to embrace the offer of a fair and honourable
treaty,¹ equally advantageous to the republic, and to the house of
Constantine. ln this negociation Julian claimed no more than he
already pofl'effed. The delegated authority which he had long exer-
cised over the provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was still
obeyed under a name more independent and august. The soldiers
and the people rejoiced in a revolution which was not stained even
with the blood of the guilty. Florentius was a fugitive3 Lupicinus
a prisoner. The persons who were disaffecsted to the new govern-
ment were disarmed and secured; and the vacant offices were dis-
tributed‚ according to the recommendation of merit, by a prince,
who despised the intrigues of the palace, and the clamours of the:
soldiers ¹⁶.

The negociations of peace were accompanied and* supported by
the most vigorous preparatione. for war. The army, which Julian
held in readiness for immediate ac‘tion, was recruited and augmented
by the disorders of the times.. The cruel persecution of the fafifion
of Magnentius had filled Gaul with numerous bands of outlaws and'
robbers. They cheerfully accepted the offer of a general pardon
from a prince whom they could trust, submitted to the restraints of ⁴
milita-ry discipline, and retained only their implacable hatred to the
