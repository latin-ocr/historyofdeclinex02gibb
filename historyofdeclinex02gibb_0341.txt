OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 321

the first days of the reign of the new Emperor. Although he was C ξζῖΧέΡ-
firmly resolved to maintain the station which he had assumed, he was k--sr--t
still defirous of saving his country from the calamities of civil war,
of declining a contest with the superior forces of Constantius, and of
preserving his own charaeter from the reproach os perfidy and ingram

titude. Adorned with the ensigns of military and Imperial pomp,
Julian shewed himself in the field of Mars to the soldiers, who
glowed with ardent enthufiasm in the cause of their pupil, their
leader, and their friend. He recapitulated their vietories‚ lamented
their sufferings, applauded their resolution, animated their hopes,
and checked their impetuosity3 nor did he dismiss the assembly, till
he had obtained a solemn promise from the troops, that if the em«—
peror of the East would subscribe an equit-able treaty‚ they would
renounce any views of conquest, and satisfy themselves with the
tranquil poffeffion of the Gallie provinces. On this foundation he·
composed, in his own name, and in that of the army, a specious and.
moderate epistle ¹⁵, which was delivered to Pentadius, his master of
the offices, and to his chamberlain Eutherius 3 two ambasl'adors whom
he appointed to receive the answer, and observe the dispositions of
Constantius. This epistle is inscribed with the modest appellation
of Caesar3 but Julian solicits in a peremptmy, though respectful
manner, the confirmation of the title of Augustus. He acknow-
ledges the irregularity of his own electiom while he justifies, in
some measure, the resentment and violence of the troops which had
extorted his reludant consent. He allows the supremacy of his
brother Constantius3 and engages to send him an annual present of
>Spanissi horses, to recruit his army with a sele& number of Barba-
rian youths, and to accept from his choice a P1·aetorian praese& of
