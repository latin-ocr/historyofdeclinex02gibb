or ἑΓΗΕ ROMAN EMPIRE.

Hippodrome has been long since defaeed by the rude hands of the
Turkish conquerors: but, under the fimilar appellation of Atmeidan,
it still serves as a place of exercise for their horses. From the
throne, whence the emperor viewed the Circenfian games, a wind-
ing staircase 4⁹ descended to the palace3 a magnificent edifice, which
scarcely yielded to the refidence of Rome itself, and which, toge-
ther with the dependent courts, gardens, and portieoes, covered a
considerable extent of ground upon the banks of the Propontis be-
tween the Hippodrome and the church of St. Sophia ⁵0. We might
likewise celebrate the baths, which still retained the name of Zeu-
xippus, after they had been enriched, by the munificence of Constan—
tine, with lofty columns, various marbles, and above threescore
statues of bronze ⁵¹. But we should deviate from the design of this
history, if we attempted minutely to describe the different buildings
or quarters of the city. It may be sufficient to observe, that what-
ever could adorn the dignity of a great capital, or contribute to the
benefit or pleasure of its numerous inhabitants, was contained within
the walls of Constantinople. A particular description, composed

about a century after its foundation, enumerates a capitol or school

differences between them are occasioned only
by the injuries which it has sustained from
the Turks. Mahomet the Second broke the
under-jaw of one of the serpents with a stroke
of his battle—axe. Theven0t‚ l. i. c. 17.

⁴⁹ The Latin name Cochlea was adopted
by the Greeks, and very frequently occurs in
the Byzantine history. Ducange Const. l. ii.

⁵¹ There are three topographical points
which indicate the situation of the palace.
r. The stair-case, which connected it with the
Hippodrome, or Anne-idam. z. A small ar-
tificial port on the Propontis, from whence
there was an easy astent, by a slight of mar-
ble stepS, to the gardens of the palace. 3.

fide of which was occupied by the front of
the palace‚ and another by xhe church of
St. Sophia.

⁵¹ Zeuxippus was an epithet of Jupiter,
and the baths were a part of old Byzantium.
The difficulty of affigning their true situation
has not been felt by Ducange. History seems
to connect them with St. Sophia and the pa-
lace 3 but the original plan, inserted in Ban-
duri, places them on the other fide of the
city, near the harbour. For their beauties,
see Chron. Paschal, p. 283, and Gyllius de
Byzant. l. ii. c. 7. Christodorus (see Anti-
quitat. Const. 1. vii.) composed inscriptions
in verse for each of the statues. He was a
Theban poet in genius as well as in birth:
