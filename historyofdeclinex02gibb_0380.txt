polythcism wa8‚ in some measure, excused by the moderation of
its claims3 and the devotion of the Pagans was not incompatible
with the most licentious scepticism ¹². Instead of an indivifible and
regular system, which occupies the vhole extent of the believing
mind, the mygtholo y of the Greeks was composed of a thousand
loose and flexible parts, and the servant of the gods was at liberty
to define the degree and measure of his religious saith. The creed

which Julian adopted for his own use, was of the largest dimensions3
and, by a strange contradiction, he disdained the salutary yoke of the
Gospcl, whilst he made a voluntary offering of his reason on the
altars of Jupiter and Apollo. One of the orations of Julian is con-
secrated to the honour of Cybele, the mother of the gods, who re·-
quired from her effeminate priests the bloody sacrifice, so ralhly
performed hythe madness of the Phrygiam boy. The pious em-
