The speedy march and intrepid attack of the Chersonites, by divert-
ing the attention of the Goths, affisted the operations of the Impe-
rial generals. The Goths, vanquished on every fide, were driven
into the mountains‚ where, in the course of a severe campaign,
above an hundred thousand were computed to have perished by cold
and hunger. Peace was at length granted to their humble supplica-
tions; the eldest son of Araric was accepted as the most valuable
liostage3 and Constantine endeavoured to convince their chiefs, by a
liberal distribution of honours and rewards, how far the friendship
of the Romans was preferable to their enmity. In the expressions

of his gratitude towards the faithful Chersonites‚ the emperor was
still more magnificent. The pride of the nation was gratified by the

splendid and almost royal decorations bestowed on their magistrate
and his succeffors. A perpetual exemption from all duties was stipu-

lated for their vessels which traded to the ports of the Black Sea. A
regular subsidy was promised, os iron, corn, oil, and of every supply
which could be useful either in peace or war. But it was thought
that the Sarmatians were sufficiently rewarded by their deliverance
from impending ruin3 and the emperor, perhaps with too stri& an
oeconomy, deduCted some part of the expences of the war from
the customary gratifications which were allowed to that turbulent
nation. v

Exasperated by this apparent neglect, the Sarmatians soon forgot‚
with the levity of Barbarians, the services which they had so lately
received, and the danger-s which still threatened their safety. Their
inroads on the territory of the empire provoked the indignation of
Constantine to leave them to their fate3 and he no longer opposed
the ambition of Geberic, a renowned warrior, who had recently
ascended the Gothic throne. Vv'isumar, the Vandal king, whilst
