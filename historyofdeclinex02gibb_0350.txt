boldly committed himself to the stream of the Danube. The labours
of his mariners, who plied their oars with incess'ant diligence, and '
the steady continuance of a favourable wind, carried his fleet above
seven hundred miles in eleven days ³²3 and he had already disem-

which hastened to claim the merit of an early submission, he passed

valour. The banks of the Danube were crowded on either fide with
