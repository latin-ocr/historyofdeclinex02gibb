THE DECLINE AND FALL

gin-{sons establilhed on the frontiers of the cmpire, amounted to live
hundred and eighty-three 3 and that, under the successors of Constan-
tine, the complete force of the military establishment was computed
at fix hundred and forty-sive thousand soldicrs ¹34. An effort so
prodigious surpassed the wants of a more anticnt, and the faculties
of a later, period.

In the various states of society, armies are recruited from very
different motives. Barbarians are urged by the love of war; the
citizens of a free republic may be prompted by a principle of duty 3
the subjects, or at least the nobles of a monarchy, are animated by a
sentiment of honour; but the timid and luxurious inhabitants of a
declining empire must be allured into the service by the hopes of
profit, or compelled by the dread of punishment. Thc resources of
the Roman treasury were exhausted by the encrease of pay, by the
repetition of donatives, and by the invention of new emoluments and
indulgences, which, in the opinion of the provincial youth, might
compensate the hardships and dangers ofa military life. Yet, although
the stature was lowered ¹55, although ssaves, at least by a tacit
connimnce, were indiscriminately received into' the ranks, the insur-
mountable difficulty of procuring a regular and adequate supply of
volunteers, obliged the emperors to adopt more effeetual and coercive
rhethoris, The lands bestowed on the veterans, as the free reward
of their valour, were hencesorvvards granted under a condition, which
contains the first rudiments of the feudal tenures ; that their sons, who
succeeded to the inheritance‚ ihould devote themselves to the profes-
sion of arms, as soon as they attained the age of1nanhood3 and
their cowardly refusal was punished by the loss of honour, of fortune
