THE DECLINE AND FALL

Infidels‚ vvho envied the prosperity, and who ridiculed, even on their

theatres‚ the theological disputes of the church. Constantinople alone

enjoyed the advantage of being born and educated in the bosom of
the saith. The capital of the East had never been polluted by the

worship of 'Idols3 and the whole body of the pcople had deeply
imbibed the opinions, the virtues, and the paffions‚ which distin-
guished the Christians of that age from the restof mankind. After
the death of Alexander, the episcopal throne was disputed by Paul
and Macedonius. By their zeal and abilities they both deserved the
eminent station to which they aspired3 and if the moral character of
