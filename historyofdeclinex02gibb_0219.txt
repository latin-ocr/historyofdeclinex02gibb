OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

> langnage and motion, to the fleeting but uncommon meteors of the

air ⁴⁵. Nazarius and Eusebius are the two most celebrated orators,
who in ssudied panegyrics have labourcd tovexalt the glory of Con-
stantine. Nine years after the Roman vietory, Nazarius ⁴⁵ describes
an army of divine warriors, who seemed to fall from the sky: he
marks their beauty, their spirit, their gigantic forms, the stream
of light which beamed from their celestial armour, their patience in
suffering themselves to be heard, as well as seen, by mortals3 and
their declaration that they were sent, that they flew, to the aflistance
of the great Constantine. For the truth of this prodigy, the Pagan
orator appeals to the whole Gallie nation, in whose presence he was
then speaking3 and seems to hope that the ancient apparitions ⁴⁷
would now obtain credit from this recent and public event. The
Christian fable of Eusebius, which, in the space of twenty—fix years,
might arise from the original dream, is cast in a much more corre&
and elegant mould. In one of the marches of Constantine, he is
reported to have seen with his own eyes the luminous trophy of the
cross, placed above the meridiari sun, and inscribed with the follow-
ing words: ΒΥ THIS, CONQJER. This amazing obje& in the sky
astonissied the whole army, as well as the emperor himself, who was
yet undetermined in the choico of a religion3 but his astonishment
was convertcd into saith by the vision of the ensuing night. Christ
appeared before his eyes3 and displaying the same celestial sign of the
cross, he direCied Constantine to frame a similar standard, and to
