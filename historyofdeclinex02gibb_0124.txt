of Artaxata, the immediate successor of St. Gregory the Illuminator,
had recourse to the piety of Constantius. After the troubles had conti-
nued about three years, Antiochus, one of the officers of the house-
hold, executed with success the Imperial commiffion of restoring
Chosroez, the son of Tiridates, to the throne of his fathers, of
distributing honours and rewards among the faithful servants of the
house of Arsace13, and of proclaiming a general amnesty, which was
accepted by the greater part of the rebellious Satraps. But the Romans
derived more honour than advantage from this revolution. Chosroes
was a prince of a puny stature, and a pusillanimous spirit. Unequal
to the fatigues of war, averse to the society of mankind, he withdrew
from his capital to a retired palace, which he built on the banks of
the river Eleutherus, and in the centre of a ssiady grove3 where he
eonsumed his vacant hours in the rural sports of hunting and hawk-
ing. To secure this inglorious ease, he submitted to the conditions
of peace which Sapor condescended to i1npose3 the payment of an
annual tribute, and the restitution of the fertile province of Atropatene,
which the cour-age of Tiridates, and the victorious arms of Galerius,
had annexed to the Armenian monarchy ⁵⁸.

it may be likewise observed, that the name

a civil office of inferior dignity. See Gode-
