they durst not presume to circumscribe the powers or the duration
of the Son of an eternal and omnipotent Father. Fourscore years
after the death of Christ, the Christiane* of Bithynia declared before
the tribunal of Pliny, that they invoked him as a god: and his
divine honours have been perpetuated in every age and country,
by the various seets vvho assume the name of his disciples ³⁸.
Their tendet· reverence for the memory of Christ, and their
horror for the profane worship of any created being, would have
engaged them to affert the equal and absolute divinity of the
Logos, if their rapid aseent towards t'ne throne of heaven had not
been imperceptibly checked by the apprehension of violating the
unity and sole supremacy of the great Father of Christ and of: the
Universe. The suspense and fluctuation produced in the minds of
the Christians by these opposite tendencies, may be observed in the
writings of the theologians who flourissied after the end of the apo-
stolic age, and before the origin of the Arian controversy. Their
suffrage is claimed, with equal confidence‚ by the orthodox and by
the heretical parties; and the most inquifitive critics have fairly al-

being to the will of the Father. See Clarke's
Scripture Trinity, p. 280-287. On the
other hand, Athanafius and his folloxvers
seem unwilling to grant what they are afraid
to deny. The schoolmen extricate themselves
from this difficulty by the distinction of apre-
ceding and a concomitant will. Petav. Dogm-

sense of Deus, Θεος, Elohim, in the ancient
languages, is critically examined by Le Clere
(Ars Critica‚ p. 150—156.), and the pro-
priety of worshipping a very excellent crea·
ture, is ably defended by the &ocinian Emlyn
(Tracts² p. 29—36. 51—145.).
