OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

535

The vieinity of the Huns to the provinces of Perfia, involved them C H A P.

in frequent and bloody contests with the power of that monarchy.
But they respected, in peace, the saith of treaties; in war, the

dietates of humanity3 and their memorable vietory over Peroses,

or Firuz, displayed the moder-adon, as well as the valour, of

the Barbarians. The stcond division of their countrymen, the
Huns, who gradually advanced towards the North-west, were exer-
cised by the hardships of a colder climate, and a more laborious
march. Neceffity compelled them to exchange the filks of China,
for the furs of Siberia; the imperfestrudirnents of civilised life were
obliterated ; and the native fierceness of the Huns was exasperated by
their intercourse with the savage tribes, who were compared, with
some propriety‚ to the wild beasts of the desert. Their independe-nt
spirit soon rejetsted the hereditary succeffion of the Tanjous; and
while each hord was governed by its peculiar Mursa, their tumultu-
ary council' directed the public mensures of the whole nation. As
late as the thirteenth century, their transient refidenee on the Eastern
banks of the Volga, was attested by the name of Great Hungary ⁴⁹.
In the winter, they deseended with their flocks and herds towards the
mouth of that mighty river3 and their summer excurfions reached
as high as the latitude of Saratoff, or perhaps the confiux of the
Rama. Such at least were the recent limi-ts of the black Calmucks ⁵⁰,
who remained about a century under the protetffion of Russia3 and
who have flnce returned ‘to their native scats on the frontiers of the
Chinese empire. The march, and the return, of those wan-
