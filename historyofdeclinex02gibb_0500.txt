tronage was withdrawn, the genius of paganism, which had been
fondly raised and cherished by the arts of Julian, sunk irrecoverably
in the dust. In many cities, the temples were shut or deserted 3 the
philosophers, who had abused their transient favour, thought it pru-
dent to shave their beards, and disguise their profeffion; and the
Christians rejoiced, that they were now in a condition to forgive, or
to revenge, the injuries which they had suffered under the preced-

a wise and gracious edi& of tolerati0n3 in which Jovian explicitly
vdeclar-ed, that although he should severely punish the sacrilegious rites
of magio, his subjees might exercise, with freedom and safety‚ the
ceremonies of the ancient worship. The memory of this law has
'been preserved by the orator Themistius, who was deputed by the
senate of Constantinople to express their loyal devotion for the new
emperor. Themistius expatiates on the clemency of the Divine
