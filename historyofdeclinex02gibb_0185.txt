OF TJHE ROMAN EMPIRE.

,The conscious. pride of Julian, who was indebted only to his
sword for t-his fignal deliverance‚ was embittered by the refledfion,
that he was abandoned, betrayed, and perhaps devoted to destrudtion,
by those who were bound to affist him by every tie of honour and
· fidelity. Marcellus, master-general of the cavalry in Gaul, inter-
preting too strictly the jealous orders of the court, beheld with supine
indifference the distress of Julian, and had restrained the troops under
his command from marching to the relies of Sens. If the Caesar
had diffembled in filence so dangerous an insult, his person and
authority would have been exposed to the contempt of the world ;v
and if an adtion so criminal had been suffered to pass with impunity,
the emperor would have confirmed the suspicions, which received
a very specious colour from his past conduffit towards the princes of
the Flavian family. Marcellus was recalled, and gently dismissed.
from his office ⁷¹. In his room Severus was appointed general of
the cavalry3 an experienced soldier, of approved courage and fide-
lity, who could advise with respe&, and execute with zea13 and
who submitted, without relu6kanee, to the supreme command which
Julian, by the interest os his patroness Eusebia, at length obtained
over the armies of Gaul ⁷². A very judicious plan of operations was
adopted for the approaching campaign. Julian himself, at the head
of the remains of the veteran bandS, and of some new levies which
he had been permitted to form, boldly penetrated into the centre of
the German cantonments, and carefully re-established the fortifica-
tions of Saverne, in an advantageous post, which would either check
the incurfions, or intercept the retreat, of the enemy. At the same
