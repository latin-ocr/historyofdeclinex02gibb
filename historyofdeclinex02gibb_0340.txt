320 THE DECLINE AND FALL„

C {gxss-P· of the Sun, of Mars, of Minerva, and of all the other deities, that,

κφὛ-μ till the close of the evening which preceded his elevation, he was
utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldicrs ¹²; and it may seem
ungenerous to distrust the honour of a hero, and the truth of a phi-
losopher. Yet the superstitious confidence that Constantius was the
enemy, and that he himself was the favourite, of the gods, might
prompt him to desire, to solicit‚ and even to hasten the auspicious
moment of his reign, which was predestined to restore the ancient
religion of mankind. W'hen Julian had received the intelligence of
the conspiracy, he resigned himself to a short ssumber3 and after-
wards related to his friends, that he had seen the Genius of the empire
waiting with some impatience at his door, prefling for admittance,
and reproaching his want of spirit and ambition ¹³. Astonished and
perplexed‚ he addreffed his prayers to the great Jupiter ; who imme-
diately signified, by a clear and manifest omen, that he should sub-
mit to the will of heaven and of the army. The condue‘t which
disclaims the ordinary maxixnsrof reason, excites our suspicion and
eludes our enquiry. Whenevcr t-he spirit of fanaticism‚ at once so
credulous and so crasty, has insinuated itself into a noble mind, it
insenfihly corrodes the vital principles of virtue and veracity.
