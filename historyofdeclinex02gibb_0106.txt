THE DECLINE AND FALL

ternis, that the mother of the younger Constantine, who was ssain
three years after his father's death, survived to weep over the fate of
'her son ²⁶. Notwithstanding the positive testimony of several writers
>of the Pagan as well as of the Christian religion, there may ssill re—
main some reason to believe, or at least to suspe&, that Fausta escaped
the blind and suspicious cruelty of her husband. The deaths of a
son, and of a nephew, with the execution of a great number of
respectable, and perhaps innocent friends ²⁷, who were involved in
their fall, may be sufficient, however, to justify the discontent of
the Roman people, and to explain the satirical verses affixed to the
palace-gate, comparing the splendid and bloody reigns of Constan-

tine and Nero ²⁸.

By the death of Crispus, the inheritance of the empire seemed to
devolve on the three sons of Fausta, who have been already men-
tioned under the names of Constantine, of Constantius, and of
Constans. These young princes were successively invested with the
title' of Cresar3 and the dates of their promotior] may be referred to
the tenth, the twentieth, and the thirtieth years of the reign of
their father ²⁹. This conduct, though it tended to multiply the
future masters of the Roman world, vmight be excused by the par-

tiality of paterna] affeffion ς but it is not so easy'to understand the

that title by adoption. At least, she was not
considered as his mox-tal enemy. Julian
compares the fortune of Fausta with that of
Parysatis‚ the Persian queen. A Roman
would have more naturally recollet‘ted the
second Agrippina:
Et moi, qui sur le trone ai suivi rnes ancetres;
Mol, fille, femme, soeuret mere de vos maitres.

It is somewhat singular, that these satirical
lines should be attributed, not to an obscure
libeller, or a disappointed panior, but to
Ablavius, prime minister and favourite of
the emperor. We may now perce-ive that
the imprecations ef the Roman people were
diftated by humansty, as well as by super-
stition. Zofim. l. ii. p. ¹05·

These dates are sufficiently correft to justify
the orator.
