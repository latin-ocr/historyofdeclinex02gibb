Theodosius was transported, '111 less than four months, to the throne
of the Eastern empire: and the whole period of the history of the
world will not perhaps afford a similar example, of an elevation, at
the same time, so pure, and so honourable. The princes who
peaceably inherit the sceptre of their fathers, claim and enjoy a legal
