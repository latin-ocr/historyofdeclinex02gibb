THE DECLINE AND FALL

him to recall his decrce, provoked him to extend to all Egypt the
term of the exile of Athanasius. The zeal of the multitude rendered

Julian still more inexorable: he was alarmed by the danger of leav-

ing at the head of a tumultuous city, a daring and popular leader ;
and the language of his resentrnent discovers the opinion which he
entertained of the courage and abilities of Athanasius. The execu- ·
tion of the sentence was still delayed, by the cantion or negligence of
Ecdicius, praefect of Egypt, who was at length awakened from his
lethargy by a severe reprimand. “ Though you negle&,'’ says Julian,
“ to write to me on any other subje&, at least it is your duty to in-

“ form me of your conda& towards Athanasius, the enemy of the
“ gods. My intentions have been long since communicated to you.

“ Ι swear by the great Serapis, that unless, on the calends of Decem-
“ ber, Athanasius has departed from Alexandria, nay from Egypt,

“ the Officers of your government shall pay a fine of one hundred

“ pounds of gold. Yon know my temper: Ι am slow to condemn,

*“ but I am still ssower to forgive.” This epistle was enforced by a

short postscript, written with the emperor’s own hand. “ The con-

’“ tempt that is ssiewn for all the gods fills me with grief and indig-

“ nation. There is nothing that I should see, nothing that I should
“ hear, with more pleasure, than the expulsion of Athanasius from

“ all Egypt. The abominable wretch! Under my reign, the bap-
“ tisrn of several Grecian ladies of the-highest rank has been the ef-

’“ fe& of his persecutions ¹³³.” The death of Athanasius was not

expreſs& commanded ; but the praefect of Egypt understood, that it
was safer for him to exceed, than to negle&, the orders of an irritated
master. The archbishop prudently retired to the monasteries of the
Defert: eludcd, with his usual dexterity, the suares of the enemy3
and lived to triumph over the affies of a prince, who, in words of
