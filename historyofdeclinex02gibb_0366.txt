torian vicegerent of Africa, the notary Gaudentius, and Artemius ⁶⁶
duke of Egypt, were executed at Antioch. Artemius had reigned
the cruel and corrupt tyrant of a great province3 Gaudentius had
long prauised the arts os calumny against the innocent, the virtuous,
and even the person of Julian himself. Yet the circumstances of
their trial and condemnation were so unskilfully managed, that these
wicked men obtained, in the public opinion, the glory of suffering
for the obstinate loyalty with which they had supported the cause of
Constantius. The rest of his servants were protedted by a general
a& of oblivion ; and they were left to enjoy with impunity the bribes
which they had accepted, either to defend the oppressed, or to op-
press the friendless. This measure, which, on the soundest prin-
ciples of policy, may deserve our approbation, was executed in a
manner which seemed to degrade the majesty of the throne. Julian.
was tormented by the importunities of a multitude, particularly of
Egyptians, who loudly redemanded the gifts which they had impru-
dently or illegally bestowed3 he foresaw the endless prosecution of
vexatious suits ; and he engaged a promise, which ought always to
have been sacred, that if they would repair to Chalcedon, he would
meet them in person, to hear and determine their complaints. But
as soon as they were lauded, he iffued an absolute order, which pro-
hibited the watermen from transporting any Egyptian to Constanti-
nople 3 and thus detained his disappointed clients on the Afiatic shore,
