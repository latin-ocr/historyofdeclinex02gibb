The Supreme God had created, οι· rather, in the Platonic language,
had generated, the gradual succeffion of dependent spirits, of gods, of
daemons, of heroes, and of men; and every being which derived
its existence immediately from the First (lause, received the inherent
gift of immortality. That so precious an advantage might not be
laviihed upon unworthy objeGOE, the Creator had entrusted to the
skill andv power of the inferior gods, the office of forming the
human body, and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal,
the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms. To the conduc't of these
divine ministers he delegated the tempora] government of this lower
world3 but their imperfect administration is not exempt stom dist-ord
or error. The earth, and its inhabitants, are divided among them,
and the charaeters of Mars or Minerva, of Mercury or Venus, may
be distinffly traeed in the laws and manners of their peculial· votaries.
As long as our immortal souis are confined in a mortal prison, it is
our interest, as well as our duty, to solicit the favour, and to depre-
cate the wrath, of the powers of heaven3 whose pride is gratified
by the devotion of mankind3 and whose groffer parts may be sup-
posed to derive some nourishment from the furnes of sacrificem.
The inferior gods might sometimes condescend to animate the statues,
and to inhabit the temples, which were dedicated to their honour-
They might occasionally visit the earth, but the heavens were the
proper throne and symbol of their glory. The invariable order of
the sun, moon, and stars, was hastily admitted by Julian, as a proof
-,of their eternal duration 3 and their eternity was a sufficient evidence
