they were sternly refused by the haughty tyrant of the East3 whose
clemency had pardoned the invaders of his country. The Saracena
sometimes intercepted the stragglers of the march3 but the generals and·
troops of Sapor respected the ceffation of arms3 and Jovian was suffered
to explore the most convenient place for- the paffage of the river. The
small vessels, which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet,
performed the most effential service. They first conveyed the ern-
peror and his favourites ; and afterwards transported‚ in many

suecessive voyages‚ a great part of the army. But, as every man
was anxious for his personal safety‚ and apprehensive of being left-
on the hostile shore, the soldiers, who were too iinpatient to wait the
ssow returns of the boats, boldly ventured themselves on light hurdles,
or inflated sszins ; and, drawing after them their horses, attempted>
With various success, to swim across the river. Many of these
daring adventurers were swallowed by the waves 3 many others„
who were carried along by the violence of the stream, fell an easy
prey to the avarice‚ or cruelty, of the wild Arabs: and the loss,

which the army sustained in the paffage of the Tigris, was not in·-

landed on the western bank, they were delivered from the hostile
pursuit of the Barbarians ; but, in a laboriosis march of two hundred
miles over the plains of Mesopotamia, they endured the last extre-
mities of thirst and hunger. They were obliged to traverse‘a sandy
desert, which, in the extent of seventy miles, did not afford a single
blade of sweet grass, nor a single spring of fresh water3 and the
rest of the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either of
