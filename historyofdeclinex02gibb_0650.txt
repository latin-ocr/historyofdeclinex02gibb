THE DECLINE AND FALL

events of each day added strength and spirit to the Roman arms;
ancl the artful diligence of the emperor, who circulated the most fa·-
vourable reports of the success of the war, contributed to subduc the
pride of the Barbwians, and to animate the hopes and courage of his
subjects. If, instead of this faint and imperfect outline, we could
accuratcly represent the counsels and actions of Theodofius‚ in four
sUCCCffiVe campaigns, there is reason to believe, that his consummate
skill would deserve the applause of every military reader. The re-
public had formerly been saved by the delays of Fabius: and, while
the splendid trophies of Scipio, in the field of Zama, αἴῃ-ἃᾶ the eyes
of posterity, the camps and marches of the Dielatm· among the hills
of Campania, may claim a juster proportion of the solid and inde-
pendent fame, which the general is not compelled to share, either
with fortune or with his troops. Such was likewise the merit of
Theodosius3 and the infirmities of his body, which most unseason-
ably languilhed under a long and dangerous diseede, could not op—
press the vigour of his mind, or divert his attention from the public
service ¹¹⁸.

The deliverance and peace of the Roman provinces¹ was the

work of prudence, rather than of valour: the prudence of Theodo-
fius was seconded by fortune3 and the emperor never failed to seize,
and to improve, every favourable circumstance. As long as the su-
perior genius of Fritigern preserved the union, and directed the rno-
tions, of the Barbarians, their power was not inadequate to the
conquest os a great empire. The death of that hero, the predecessor
ancl master of the renowned Alaric, relieved an ixnpatient multitude
