of the orders, or some ignorance of the ground, the right wing, or
column of cavalry, arrived in sight of the enemy, whilst the left was
still at a considerable distance3 the soldiers were compelled, in the
sultry heat of summer, to precipitare their pace 3 and the line of
battle was formed with tedious confufion, and irregular delay. The
Gothic cavalry had been detached to forage in the adjacent country3
and Fritigern still continued to praeuse his customary arte. He dis-
patched messengers of peace, made proposals, required hostages‚ and
wassed the hours, till the Romans, exposed without ssielter to the
burning rays of the sun, were exhausted by thirst, hunger, and in-
tolerable fatigue. The emperor was persuaded to send an ambaffador
to the Gothic camp 3 the zeal of Richomer‚ who alone had eourage ⁷
to accept the dangerous commiffion, was applauded: and the count
of the domesties, adorned with the splendid enslgns of his dignsty,
had proceeded some way in the space between the two armies, when
he was suddenly recalled by the alarin of battle. The hasty and im-

body of archers and targetteer53 and as they advanced ¹with rassmess,
they retreated with loss and disgrace. In t‘he same moment, the
flying squadrons of Alatheus and Sapha-ax, whose return was anxioussy
expedstd by the general of the Goths, descended like a whirlwind
from the hills, swept across the plain, and added new terrors t'o the
tumultuous‚ but irrefistible, charge of the Barbarian host. The event
