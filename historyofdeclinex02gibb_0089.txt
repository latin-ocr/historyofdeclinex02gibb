peasants‚ whose dependent condition was a less rigid servitude ¹³³. C >ast-P.

In such a state the poor were maintained at the expence of the k--v-——J

masters, who enjoyed the fruits of their labour; and as the rolls of
tribute were filled only with the names of those citizens who pos-
seffed the means of an honourable, or at least of a decent subfistence‚
the comparative smallness of their numbers explains and justifies the
high rate of their capitation. The truth of this affertion may ber
illustrated by the following example: The AEdui‚ one of the most
powerful andr civilized tribes or cities of Gaul, occupied an extent of
territory, which now contains above five hundred thousand inhabitants,
in the two eeclefiastieal dioceses of Autun and Nevers ¹⁸⁴: and with
the probable acceflion of those of Chalons and Magon ¹³⁵, the popu-
lation would amount to eight hundred thousand souls. In the time

of Constantine, the territory of the AEdui afforded no more than
tWenty—five thousand heads of capitation, of whom seven thousand
were discharged by that prince stom the intolerablc weight of tri-

³⁸4 The ancient jurisdiction of (Ar-egidio-
dunum) Autun in Burgundy‚ the capital of
the AEdui, comprehended the adjacent terri-
tory of (Noviodunum) Nevers. See d’An-
ville, Notice de l’aucienne Gaule, p. 491.
The two dioceses of Autun and Nevers are
now composed, the former 0f610, and the
latter of 160, parilhes. The registers of
births‚ taken during eleven years, in 476
parishes of the same province ofBurgundy,
and multiplied by the moderate proportior]
of ²5 (see Meffance Recherches sur la Popu-
iation, p. ¹42·)› may authorise us to affign
an ayerage number of 656 persons for each
paristx, which being again multiplied by the
770 pariffies of the dioceses of Nevers and
Autan, will produce the sum of 505‚1zo

¹³⁵ We might derive an additional sup-
ply of 301‚75o inhabitants from the dioceses
of chalons (Cabillonum) and of Magon
(Μιιιῐχὶό) ; fince they commin, the one 200,
and the other 260, parishes. This acceffion
of territory might bejustified by very speciouss
reasons. ι. Cha-lons and Magon were un-
doubtedly within the original jurisdictiou of
the AEdui. (See d'Anville Notice, p. 187.
443.) 2. In the Notitia of Gaul, they are
enumerated not as Civitates, but merely as'
Castra. 3. They do not appear to have
been episcopal seats before the fifth and fixth
centuries. Yet there is a passage in Eume>
nius (Panegyr. Ver. viii. 7.) which very
forcibly deters me from extending the terri-
tory of the AEdui in the reign of Constantine,
along the beautiful banks of the navigable
Sacae.
