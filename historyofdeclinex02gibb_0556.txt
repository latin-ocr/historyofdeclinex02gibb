they had not sufficiently consulted' their own strength, or th'e abilities

of their leader. Before he could procure any certain intelligent-e,

that ‚the emperor of the West had fixed the choice ‘of a general, or
that a ficet of transports was collected at the mouthpf the Rhome, he
was suddenly informed‚ that the great Theodotius, with a small band
of veter-ans, had lauded near Igilgilis, or Gigeri‚ on the African
coastj. and the timid usurper sunk under the ascendant of virtue and
military genius. Though Firmus poffeffed arms and treasures, his
despairof victory immediately reduced him to the use of those arts,

which, in the same country, and in a similar situation, had formerly

been praetised by the crafty Jugurtha. He attempted to deceive,
by an apparent submiffion, the vigilance of the Roman general ; to
seduce the 'fidelity of his troops 3 and to prona& the duration of the
'wan by successlvcly engaging the independent tribes of Africa to
‘espouse his quarrel, or to prote& his ssight. Theodosius imitated
the example, and obtained the success, of his predecessor Metellus.
WVhen Firmus, in the character of ‘a suppliant, accused his own ralh-
hess, and humbly solicited the clemency of the emperor, the lieu-
tenant of Valentini-an received and dismissed him with a friendly em-
brzice 3⁷ but he diligently required the useful and substantia} pledge&
of a sincere repetitam-e, nor could he be persuaded, by the afl'urances

abandoned, according to ancient custom, to the tumult of a military
execution ; many more, by the amputation of both their hands, con-
