OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

or a judge‚ it is probable that the civil jurisprudence of the Romans
had not engaged any considerable share of his attention: but he
derived from his philosophicrstudies an inflexible regard for justice,
tempered by a disposition to clemency3 the knowledge of the general
principles of equity and evidence, and the faculty of patiently inves-
tigating the most intricate and tedious questions which could be pro-

posed for his discuffion. The measures of policy, and the operations
of war, must submit to the various accidents of circumstance and

saved by the generous resolution of a few veterana, who resumed
their arms for the defence of their country. ln his march from
Autun‚ through the heart of the Gallie provinces, Julian embraced
with ardour the earliest opportunity of signalizing his courage. At
