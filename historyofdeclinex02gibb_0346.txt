“ an, orphan ¹.” interrupted Julian, who justified his cause by in·-
dulging his passions: “ Does the affaffin of my family reproach me

epistle, in which Julian expreffed, in a strain of the most vehement
eloquencc, the sentiments of contempt, of hatred, and of resent-
ment, which had been suppreffed and embittered by the diffimula-
tion of twenty years. After this meffiige, which might be confidered
as a signal of irreconcilable war, Julian, who, some weeks before,
had celebrated the Christian festival of the Epiphany ²², made a pub·-
lie declaration that he committed the care of his safety to the ΙΜ-
MORTAL GODS3 and thus publicly renounced the religion, as well
as the friendship, of Constantius ²³.

The situation of Julian required a vigorous and immediate reso-

lution. He had discovered, from intercepted letters, that his adver-

sary, sacrificing the interest of the state to that of the monarch, had Ι

again exeited the Barbarians to invade the provinces of the West.

januario, Christiani Epiphania dievtant, pro-
gressus in eorum ecelesiam, solemniter numi-
ne orato disteffit. Ammian. xxia. Zona-
ras observes, that it was on Christmas-day‚
and his ass‘ertion is not inconsistent; since
the churches of Egypt, Asia, aud perhaps
Gaul, celebrated on the same day (the sixth
cf Jmuary), the nativity and the baptism
cf their Snvionr. The Romam, :s iguo-
rant as their brothton cf the real date of his
birth, fixed the solemn festival to ilie :5tl1 of
December, the E--anaf'ia, or winter solstice,
when the Pagus annually celebrated the

birth of the Sun. See Bingham’s Antiqui-
ties of the Christian Church, l. xx. c. 4. and

²³ The public and secret negociations be-
tween Constantius and julian, must be ex-
moed, with forne cantion, from Julian him-
self (Orat. ad S. P. Q Athen. p. 286.)‚
