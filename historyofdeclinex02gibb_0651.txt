OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

from the intolerable yoke of discipline and discretion. The Barba--
rians, who had been restrained by his authority, abandoned them-
selves to the dietates of their passions3 and their passions were seldom
uniform‚ or consistent. An army of conquerors was broken into
many disorderly bands of savage robbers; and their blind and irre-
gular fury was not less pernicious to themselves, than to their ene-
mies. Their mischievous disposition was ssiewn in the desti-uffion of
every ol)je<5t‚ which they wanted strength to remove, or taste to
enjoy ; and they often consumed, with improvident rage, the harvests‚-
or the granaries, which soon afterwards became neceffary sor their
own subfistence. A spirit of diseord arose among the independent
tribes and nations, which had been united only by the hands of a
loose and voluntary alliance. The troops of the Huns and the·
Alani would naturally upbraid the ssight of the Goths ς who were not
disposed to use with moderation the advantage& of their fortune: the*
ancient jealousy of the Ostrogoths and the Vifigoths could not long
be suspended3 and the haughty chiefs still remembered the insults
and inj uries, which they had reciproeally offered, or sustained', while

the nation was seated in the countries beyond the Danube. The

progress of domestic fafition abated the more diil'usive sentiment of
national animofity3 and the Officers of Theodosius were instruGted to
purchase, with liberal gifts and promises, the retreat, or service, of
the discontented party. The acquifition of Nlodar, a prince of the
royal blood of the Amali, gave a bold and faithful champion to the¹
cause of Rome. The illustrious deserter soon obtained the rank of
master-general, with an important command3 surprised an army of
his countrylnen, who were immersed in wine and sseep3 and, after
a cruel ssaughter of the astonilhed Goths, returned with an immense
spoil, and four thousand waggons, to the Imperial camp ¹²³. In the
