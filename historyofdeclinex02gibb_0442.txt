of a venal court, who adored the Imperial purple ; but he was deeply
flattered by the praise, the admonition‚ the freedom, and the envy
of an independcnt philosopher, who refused his savoum, loved his
person, celebrated his fame, and prote&ed his memory. The volu-
minous writings of Libanius still exist3 for the most part, they are
the vain and idle compofitions of an orator, who cultivated the seienee
of word33 the produzffions of a recluse student, whose mind, regard-
less of his contemporaries, was inceffantly fixed on the Trojan war,
and the Athenian commonwealth. Yet the sophist of Antioch some-
times deseended from this imaginary elevation 3 he entertained a
various and elaborate correspondenee ²⁶ 3 he praised the virtues of his
own time33 he boldly arraigned the abuses of public and private
life 3 and he eloquently pleaded the cause of Antioeh against the just
resentment of Julian and Theodosius. It is the common calamity
of old age ²⁷, to lose whatever might have rendered it desirable3 but
Libanius experieneed the peculias misfortune of surviving the reli-
gion and the seicuees, to which he had consecrated his genius. The
friend of Julian was an indignant speetator of the triumph of Chris-
tianity ; and his bigot1·y, which darkened the prospe& of the visible
world, did not inspire Libanius with any lively hopes of celestial

glory and happiness ²³.
