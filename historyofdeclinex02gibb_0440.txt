Julian com-
poses a satire
against An*
tinch.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

and the cruelty of the faithful legions of Gaul. A milder sentence
might have deprived the capital of the East of its honours and privi-
leges ; and the courtiers‚ perhaps the subjeffl, of Julian, would
have applauded an a& of justice, which asserted the dignity of the
supreme magistrate of the republic ¹⁹. But instead of abufing, or:
exerting‚ the authority of the state, to revenge his persona} injuria,-
Julian contented himself with an inoffenfive mode> of retaliation,
which it would be in the power of few princes to employ. He had
been insulted by satires and libels3 in his turn he composed‚ under
the title of the Enemy qf the Bemd, an ironical confeffion of his own·
faults, and a severe satire of the licentious and effeminate manners of
Antioch. This Imperial reply was publicly exposed before the gates
of the palace3 and the NlISOPOGON ²⁰ still remains a singular mo·-
nument of theresentment, the wit, the humanity‚ and the indiscre-ss
tion of Julian. Though* he affeeted to laugh, he could not forgive ²¹.ss
His contempt was expreffed, and his revenge might be gratifiedg„
by the nomination of a governor ²² worthy only of such subjeetsz.
and the emperor, for ever renouncing the ungrateful city, proclaimed

his resolution to pass the ensuing winter at Tarsus in Cilicia ²³. ’

¹⁹ Libanius (ad Antiochen.c. vii. p. 213.)
reminds Antioch of the recent chastisemcnt
of Caesarea: and even Julian (in Misopogon,
p. 353.) insinuatos how severelyTarentum had
expiated the insuit to the Roman ambassa-
dors.

rentalifi, c. xcix. p. 3²3·)› Gregery Nazianw

lation and netes of the Abbe de la Bleterie

²¹ Ammianus veryjustly remarks, Coactus
distimulare pro tempore iri sufflabatur inter-
nf‘.. The elaborate irony ofJulian at length

bursts forth into serious and dire& invec-
τινε.

judicem convenire. Ammian. xxiii. z. Li-
banius (Epist. 7²2· p. 346, 34²), who con-
fess'es to Julian himself, that he had {hai-ed
the general discontent, pretends thazAzexan-

the manners and religion of Antioch.
