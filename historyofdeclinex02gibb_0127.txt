oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 107

Whatever advantages might attend the arms of Sapor in the field, C &wil P.
though nine repeated vietories diffused among the nations the fame ³--r ⁸ Δ

of his valour and conduct, he could not hope to succeed in the exe· {gg οἳ Nl·
cution of his defigns‚ while the fortified towns of Nlesopotamia, and

above all, the strong and antient city of Nisibis, remained in the
poffession of the Romans. In the space of twelve years, Nisibis,

which, since the time of Lucullus, had been deservedly esteemed the

bulwark of the east, sustained three memorable fieges against the A. D. 338·
power of Sapor; and the disappointed monarch, after urging his ³46' ³⁵O‘
attacks above fixty, eighty5 and an hundred days, was thrice re*

pulsed with loss and ignominy ⁶³. This large and populous city

was fituate about two days journey from the Tigris, in the midst

of a pleasant and fertile plain at the foot of mount Mafius. A

treble inclosure of brick walls was defended by a deep ditch ⁶⁴3 and

the intrepid resistance of Count Lucilianus, and his garrison, was

seconded by the desperate courage of the people. The citizens of

Nifibis were animated by the exhortations of their bishop ⁵³, inured to

arms by the presence of danger, and convinced of the intentioris

of Sapor to plant a Persian colony in their room, and to lead them

away into distant and barbarous captivity. The event of the two

former fieges elated their confidence3 and exasperated the haughty

spirit of the Great King, who advanced a third time towards Nifibis,
