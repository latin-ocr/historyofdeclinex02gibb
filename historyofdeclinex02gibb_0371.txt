[OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, 35}

&acted a tribute from the adjacent republics, for the purpose of d'e- C {fxii} P.
fraying the games of the Isthmus, which were celebrated in the amu> 0--w--a
phitheatre with the hunting of bears and panther-s. From this tri-
bute the cities of Elis‘, of Delphi, and of Argos, which had inhe-
rited from their remote ancestors the sacred office of perpetuating the*
Olympio, the Pythian, and the Nemean games, claimed a just ex-

emption. The immunity of Elis and Delphi was respestecl by the

Corinthians3 but the poverty of Argos temptecl the insolence of op-
preffion; and the feeble complaints of its deputies were silenced by

the decree of a provincial magistrate, who seems to have consulted
only the interest of the capital, in which he refided. Seven years
after this sentence, Julian ⁷⁹ allowed the cause to be referred to a

superior tribuna13 and his eloquence was interposed‚ most probably
with success, in the defencc of a city, which had been the royal seat
of Agamemnon ²³⁰, and had given to Macedonia a race of king-s and

conquerors ⁸¹.
