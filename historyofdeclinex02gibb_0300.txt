THE DECLINE AND FALL

abused the authority of a credulous monarch. The monarch himself
a‘vowed the resolution, which he had so long suppreffed, of avenging
his private injuries ¹¹⁶3 and the first winter after his victory, which
he passed at Arles, was employed against an enemy more odious to

If the emperor had caprieioussy decreed the death of the most emi-
