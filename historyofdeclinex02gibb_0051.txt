OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

have been very inconsistent with the character and policy of Con-
stantine3 but had he serioussy entertained such a design, it might
have exceeded the measure of his power to ratify, by an arbitr-ary
edidi, an institution* which must expect the fimffifion of time and of
opinion. He revived, indeed, the title of PATRICIANs, but he re-
vived it as a personal, not as an hereditary distinction. They yielded
only to the tranfient superiority of the annual consuls3 but they en-
joyed the pre-eminence over all the great officers of state, with the
most familiar access to the person of the prince. This honourable
rank was bestowed on them for life3 and as they were usually favour-

of Severus to that of Diocletian, the guards and the palace‚ the laws
and the finances, the armies and the provinces, were entrusted to
their superintending care3 and, like the Vizirs of the East, they
held with one hand the seal, and with the other the standard, of the
empire. The ambition of the praefeC’oe, always formidable and some-
times fatal to the masters whom they served, was supported by the
strength os the Praetorian band83 but after those haughty troops
had been weakened by Diocletian, and finally suppresl'ed by Con—
stantine, the praefects, who survived their fall, were reduced without
difficulty to the station of useful and obedient ministers. YVhen they
were no longer responsible for the safety of the emperor's person,
