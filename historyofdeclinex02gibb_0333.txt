OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

into the most dangerous crimes; if the inconstant multitude should
prefer their inclinatione, to their duty3 or if the general of a victorious
army ssmuld be tempted from his allegiance by the hopes of revenge,
and independent greatness. The personal fears of Constantius were
interpreted by his council as a laudable anxiety for the public safety3
whilst in private, and perhaps in his own breast‚ he disguised, under
the less odious appellation of fear, the sentiments of hatred and envy,
which he had secretly conceived for the inimitable virtues of Ju-
lian.

The apparent tranquillity of Gaul, and the imminent danger of
the eastern provinces, offered a specious pretence for the defign
which was artfully concerted by the Imperial ministers. They re-
solved to disarm the Caesam to recall those faithful troops who
guarded his person and dignity3 and to employ in a distant war
against the Persian monarch, the hardy veterans who had vanquished,
on the banks of the Rhine, the fiercest nations of Germany. While
Julian used the laborious hours of his winter-quartem at Paris in the
administration of power, which, in his hands, was the exercise of
virtue, he was surprised by the hasty arrival of a tribune and a no-

tary; with positive orders from the emperor, which they were di-
maed to execute, and he was commanded not to oppose. Constan-

tIus fignified his pleasure‚ that four entire legions, the Celtae, and
Petulants, the Heruli, and the Batavians, should be separated from
the standard of Julian, under-which they had acquired their fame
and discipline3 that in each of the remaining hands, three hundred
of the bravest youths should be selected3 and that this numerous
detaehment, the strength of the Gallie army, should instantly begin
their march„ and exert their utmost diligence to arrive, before the
¹opening of the campaign, on the frontiers of Perfia ⁴. The Caesar
