and two hundred and forty—three soldiers, in this memorable battle
of Strasburgh, so· glorious to the Caesar ⁷⁶, and so salutary to the
afflieted provinces of Gaul. Six thousand of the Alemanni were ssain
in the field, without including those who were drowned in the
Rhine, or transfixed with darts whilst they attempted to swim across
the river ⁷⁷. Chnodomar himself was suri-ounded and taken prisoner,
