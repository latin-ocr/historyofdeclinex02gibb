publicly profeffed the arts of .rhetoric and declamation at Nice, A.D. 3¹4-

Nicomedia, Constantinople‚ Athens, and, during the remainder of
his life, at Antioch. His school was affiduoussy frequented by the
Grecian youth3 his disciples, who sometimes exceeded the number of
eighty, celebrated their incomparable master ; and the jealousy of his
rivals, who persecuted him from one city to another, confirmed the
favourable opinion which Libanius ostentatioussy displayed of his
superior merit. The praeceptors of Julian had extorted a rash but
solemn affurance, that he would never attend the lectures of their
adversary: the curiosity of the royal youth was checked and in-
flamed: he secretly proeured the writings of this dangerous sophist,
and gradually surpaffed, in‘ the perse& imitation of his style, the most
laborious of his domestic pupils ²⁴. When Jnlian ascended the
throne, he declax-ed his impatience to embrace and reward the Syriam
sophist, who had preserved, in a degenerate age, the Grecian purity
of taste, of manners, and of religion. The emperor's prepoffeffion·
was encreased and justified by the discreet pride of his favourite.
Instead of preffing, with the foremost of the crowd, into the pa-
Lice of Constantinople, Libanius calmly expected his arrival at An-
tioch 3* withdrew from court on the first symptoms of coldness and
indifference3 required a formal invitation for each visit 3 and taught

friend. Ἴ The sophists of every age, despifing, or affecting to despise,
