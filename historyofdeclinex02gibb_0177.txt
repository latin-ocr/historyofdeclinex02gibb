As soon as the first transports of viCtory had subsided, Sapor was at
leisure to refled, that to chastise a disobedient city, he had lost the
flower of his troops, and ‘the most favourable season for conquest⁵⁹.

It is more than probable, that the

inconstancy of his Barbarian allies was temptcd to relinquiih a war
in which they had encountered such [inexpedied difficultie33 and that
the aged king of the Chionites, sitiated with revenge, turned away

apparent contradiftions, we must allow for
some delay in the Perfian king, some inaccu-
