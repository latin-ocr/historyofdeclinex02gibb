the deceased Constantine, who, many years after the event, in the

freedom of conversation, had related to him this extraordinary inci-

to produce a sxugle testimony from the Fa-

in their voluminous writings, repeatedly ce-

Constantine. As these venerable men had
not any dissike to a miracle, we may suspe&

rauce of Jerom) that they were all unac-
quainted with the lise of Constantine by Eu-
sebius. This traft was recovered by the di-
ligence of those who translated or continued
his Ecclesiastical History, and who have re-
presented in various colours the vision of the
