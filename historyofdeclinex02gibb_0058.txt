trusted, during the pleasure of the prince, and under the authority
of the praefects or their deputies, with the administration of justice
and the finances in their *respective districts. The ponderous vo-
lumeS' of the Codes and Pande-{ts ¹¹³ would furnish ample mate-
rials for a minute inquiry into the system of provincial govern-
ment‚ as in the space of fix centuries it was improved by the wisdom
of the Roman statesmen and lawyers. It may be sufficient for the
historian to select two singular and salutary provisions intended to
restrain the abuse of authority. 1. For the preservation of peace and
order, the governors of the provinces were arrned with the sword of
justice. They inflicsted corporal punissnnents, and they exercised,
in capital offences, the power of life and death. But they were not
authorised to indulge the condemned criminal with the choice of his
own execution, or to pronouncc a sentence of the mildest and most
honourable kind of exile. These prerogatives were reserved to the
praefcfiss, who alone could impose the heavy fine of fifty pounds of
gold: their vicegerents were confined to the trifling weig'nt of a few
ounces ¹¹4. This distinction, which seems to grant the larges, while
it denies the smaller degree of authority, was founded on a very ra-
tional motive. The smaller degree was infinitely more liable to abuse.
The passions of a provincial magistrate might frequently provoke him
into acts of oppression, which affected only the freedom or the for-
runes of the subjeet3 though, from a principle of prudence, perhaps
of humanity, he might still be terrified by the guilt of innocent blood.
