colleffcing his scattered' forces, had led them into the field to encoun-
ter a vicloricus enemy, his army would have been vanquilhed by

the chance of success. But the great Theodofius, an epithet which
he honourably deserved on this momentous occasion, condueced him-
self as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic. He fixed his
head—quartem at Thessalonica, the capital of the Macedonian dio-
