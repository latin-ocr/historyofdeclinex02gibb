OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 555

tempts against the walls of Sirmium, the indignant Barbarians turned 0313(ss- P.
their arms against the master-general of the frontier, to whom they ι--Ὑ--Ι
unjustly attributed the murder of their king. Equitius could bring

into the field no more than two legions; but they contained

the veteram strength of the Maesian and Pannonian banda. The
obstinacy with which they disputed the vain honours of rank

and precedency, was the cause of their destr11&ion; and, while

⁷ they acted with separate forces and divided councils, they were

surprised and ssaughtered by the active vigour of the Sarmatian

horse. The success of this invafion provoked the emulation of

the bordering tribe83 and the province of Maefia would infal-

libly have been lost, if young Theodofius, the duke, or military
commander‚ of the fronder, had not fignalised, in the defeat of the

public enemy, an intrepid genius, 'vx-orthy of his illustrious father,

and of his future grcatness ¹⁵⁰.

from the banks of the Moselle: and to the suppliant ambaffadors of
the Sarmatians, who met him on the way, he returned a doubtful
answcss that, as soon as he reached the scene of adiion, he should
examine, and pronounce. When he arrived at Sirmium, he gave
audience to the deputies of the Illyrian province53 who loudly con-
gratulated their own felicity under the auspicious government of Pro-

bus, his Praetorianpraefec’t ¹⁵¹. Valentinian, who was flattered by these
