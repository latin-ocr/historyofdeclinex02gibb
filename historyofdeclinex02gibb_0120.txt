THE DECLINE AND FALL

the Imperial house, servecl only to convince mankind, that these
princes were as cold to the endearments of conjugal affe&ion‚
as they were insenfible to the ties of consanguinity, and the moving
entreaties of youth and innocence. Of so numerous a family,
Gallus and Julian alone, the two youngest children of Julius Con-
stantius, were saved from the hands of the affaffins, till their rage,
satiated with ssaugffler, had in some measure subfided. The emperor
Constantius, who, in the absence of his brothers, was the most ob—
noxious to guilt and reproach, discovered, on some future occasions,
a faint and transient remorse for those cruelties which the perfidious
counsels of his ministers, and the irrefistible violence of the troops,
had extorted from his unexperienced youth ⁵².

of the provinces3 which was ratified in a personal interview of the
three brothers. Constantine, the eldest of the Caesars, obtained,
with a certain pre-eminence of rank, the poffeffion of the new
capital, which bore his own name and that of his father. Thrace,
and the countries of the east, were allotted for the patrimony of Con-
stantius; and Constans was acknowledged as the lawful sovereign of
Italy, Africa, and the western Illyricum. The armies submitted to-
their hereditary right5 and they condescended, after some delay,
