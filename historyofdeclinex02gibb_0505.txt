preserved ‚his own, and the public, esteem. The avocations of a
military life had diverted his youth from the elegant pursuits of
literature3 he was ignorant of the Greek language, and the arts
of rhetoric; but as the mind of the orator was never disconcerted
by timid perplexity, he was able, as often as the occasion prompted
him, to deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready elocu-
tion. The laws of martial discipline were the only laws that he had
studiec'l ; and he was soon distinguilhed by the laborious diligence,
and inflexible severity, with which he discharged and inforced the
(luties of the camp. In the time ofJulian he provoked the danger of
disgrace, by the contempt which he publicly express'ed for the reigning
religion ²²3 and it ssiould seem, from his subsequent conduci, that the
indiscreet and unseasonable freedom of Valentinian was the effe& of mi·-
litary spirit, rather than of Christian zeal. He was sardoned, however,
and still employed by a prince who esteemed his merit ²³: and in the
various events of the Persian war, he improved the reputation which
he had already acquired on the banks of the Rhine. The celerity
and success with which he executed an important commiffion, recom-
mended him to the favour of Jovian3 and to the honourable com-
mand of the second school, or company, of Turgetteers, of the domestic
guards. In the march from Antioch, he had reached his quarters at
Ancyra, when he was unexpeQedly summoned, without guilt, and
without intrigue, to assume, in the forty-third year of his age, the
absolute government of the Roman empire.
