the weight and terror of a formidable neighbourhood: and the flight
of the tribes os Scythia would inevitably tend to increase the
strength, or to contra& the telritories, of the Huns. The harssi and
obscure appellations of those tribes would offend the ear, without in-
forming the understanding, of the reader3 but I cannot suppress the·
very natural suspicion, that the Huns of the Northv derived a consi--
derable reinforcement from the ruin of the dynasty of the South,
which, in the course of the third century, submitted to the dominion-
of China3 that the bravest warriors marched away i'n search of their

³¹ This great transmigration of 300,000
Calmucks‚ or Torgout5‚ happened in the year
1771. The original narrative of Kien-long,
the reigning emperor of China, which was
intended sor the inscription of a column,
has been transsated by the miffionaries of Pe-
kin (Memoire sur la Chim, tom. i. p.
401—418). The emperor affefls the smooth
and specious lan'guage of the Son of Heaven,
and the Father of his People.

⁵² The Kang-Mou (tom. iii. p. 447.)
ascribes to their conquests a space ofi4,000 lis.

According to the present standard, 203 lis*
(or more accurately 193) are equa] to one de- ’
gree of latitude3 and one English mile con-
sequently exceeds three miles οε China. But
there :ire strong reasons to believe that the an-
cient li scarcely equalled one-half of the mo-
dern. See the elaborate researches of M. d’An-
ville, a geognapher, who is not a stranger in
any age, or climate, of the globe (Memoires
de 1’Acad. tom. ii. p. 125—502. Mesures
hineraioes, p. 154—167).
