OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

bridges of floating rafts which were supported by the help of bladders.
Two cities of Affyria presumed to reslst the arms of a Roman em-

peror: and they both paid the severe penalty of their rashness. At Siege Οἵ

the distance of fifty miles from the royal refidcnce of Ctesiphon,
Perisabor, or Anbar, held the second rank in the province: a ci'ty,
large, populous, and well forfified, surrounded with a double wall,
almost encompassed by a branch of the Euphrates, and defended
by the valour, of a numerous garrison. The exhortations of
Hormisdas were repulsed with contempt3 and the ears of the Per-
fian prince were wounded by a just repmach, that, unmindful

king and country. The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a
skilful, as well as vigorous, defence3 till the lucky stroke of a
battering-ram, having opened a large breach, by ffiattering one of
the angles of the wall, they hastily retired into the fortifications of
the interior citadel. The soldiers of Julian rushed impetuoussy into
the town3 and, after the full gratification of every military appetite,
Perisabor was reduced to ashes ; and the engines which ass'aulted the
citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking houses. The

contest was continued by an inceffant and mutual discharge of
miflile weapons 3 and the superiority which the Romans might derive

could engage on equal ternis with the loftiest ramparts; the tre-
mendous aspect of a moving tun-et, that would leave no hope of
refistance or of mercy, terrified the defenders of the citadel into an
humble sub1niffion; and the place was surrendered onlxy two days
after Julian first appeared under the walls of Perisabor. Two
