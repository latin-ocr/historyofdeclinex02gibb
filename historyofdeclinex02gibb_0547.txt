nity of an independent kingdom, have multiplied, by an equal and C {IXQ-P·
voluntary union, the honours of the English name. The hand of ι--ψ--ι
nature had contributed to mark the ancient distinction of the Scots

and Pius. The former were the men of the hills, and the latter
those of the plain.. The eastern coast of Caledonia may be consi·-
dered as a level and fertile country, which, even in a rude state of
tillage, was capable of producing a confiderable quantity of corn:
and the epithet of cruitnich, or wheat-eaters, expreffed the contempt,
or envy, of the carnivorous highlander. The cultivation of the
earth might introduce a more accurate separation of property, and
the habits of a sedentary life 3 but the love of arms and rapine wa>
still the ruling paflion of the Picti· ε and their warriors, who stripped
themselves for a day of battle, were distinguished, in the eyes ot*
the Romans, by the strange faihion of painting their naked bodicss,
with gaudy colours and 'fantastic figures. The western part of Ca·-

ledonia irregularly rises into wild and barren hills, which scarcely
repay the toil of the husbandman, and are most profitably used for
the pasture of cattle. The highlanders werevcondemned to the oc-
cupations of shepherds and hunters; and, as they seldom were fixed
to any permanent habitation‚ they acquired the expreflive name of
SCOTS‚ which, in the Celtic tongue‚ is said to be equivalent to that
of wanderers, or vagranls. The inhabitants of a barren land were
urged to seek a fresh supply of food in the water‘s. The deep lakes
and bays which interfect their country, are plentifully stored with
fnh ; and they gradually ventured to cast their nets in the waves of
the ocean„ The vicinity of the Hebrides, so profusely scattcrcd‘ along
the western coast of Scotland, tenipted their curiosity, and improved
their sszill·, and they acquired, by [low degrees, the art, or rather
the habit, of managing their boats in a tempestuous sea, and of steor-
ing their nocturnal course by thc light of tli'c well—known stains.
