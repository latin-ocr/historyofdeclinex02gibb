OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 95

alone and unaffisted, he defended his dominions with undaunted c H A P.
courage, was vanquilhed and ssain in a decifive battle which svvept „Q
away the flower of the Sarmatian youth. The remainder of the

nation embraced the desperate expedient of arming their ssaves, a
hardy race of hunters and herdsmen, by whose tumultuary aid they

revenged their defeat, and expelled the invader from their confines.
But they soon discovered that they had exchanged a foreign for a
domestic enemy, more dangerous and more implacable. Enraged
by their former servitude, elated by their present glory, the ssaves,
under the name of Limigantes, claimed and usurped the poffeffion of
the country which they had saved. Their masters, unable to with-
stand the ungoverned fury of the populace, preferred the hardlhipa
of exile, to the tyranny of their servants. Some of the fugitive
Sarmatians solicited a less ignominious dependence‚ under the hostile
standard of the Goths. A more numerous band retired beyond the
Carpathian mountains, among the Qadi, their German allies, and
were easily admitted to share a superfluous waste of uncultivated
land. But the far greater part of the distreffed nation turned their
eyes towards the fruitful provinces of Rome. Imploring the protec-
tion and forgiveness of the emperor, they solemnly promised, as
subjecte in peace, and as soldiers in war, the most inviolable fidelity
to the empire which should gracioussy receive them into its bosom.
According to the maxime adopted by Probus and his-succeff01·s‚ the
offers of this Earbarian colony were engerly accepted3 and a compe-
tent portion of lande in the provinces of Pannonia, Thrace, Mace-
donia, and Italy, were immediately assigned sor the habitation and
subsistence of three hundred thousand Sarmatians ⁴⁵.
