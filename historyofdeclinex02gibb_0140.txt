right; while their left, either from the nature of their disposition, or

flank of Magnentius ³³. The troops on both fides remained under

eloquent speech, retired into a church at some distance from the field
of battle, and committed to his generals the conduct of this decisive
day ⁸⁴. They deserved his confidence by the valour and military
skill which they exerted. They wifely began the action upon the
