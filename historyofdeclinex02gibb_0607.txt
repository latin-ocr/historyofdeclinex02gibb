OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

wives and children, their dependents and allies, were'transported to
the West of the Volga: and they boldly advanced to invade the
country of the Alani, a pastoral people who occupied& or wasted, an
extenfive tra& of the deserts of Scythia. The plains between the
*Volga and the Tanais were covered with the tents of the Alani, but
their name and manners were diffused over the wide extent of their
conquests; and the painted tribes of the Agathyrsi and Geloni were
confounded among their vaffals. Towards the North, they pene-
