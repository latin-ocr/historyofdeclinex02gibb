name of Erin, or Ierne, *or Ireland. It is probable, that in some ”
remote period of antiquity, the fertile plains of Ulster received a
colony of hungry Scots; and that the strangers of the North, who
had dared to encounter ‘the arms of the legions, spread their con-
quests over the savage and unwarlike natives of a solitary issand, It
is certain, that, in the declining age of the Roman empire, Caledo-
nia, Ireland, and the Isse of Man, were inhabited by the Scots ς and
that the kindred tribes, who were often associated in military en-
πεῖ-μῖξις, were deeply affected by the various accidente, of their rnu-
mal fortunes. They long cherissied the lively tradition of their
common name and origin: and the missionaries of the Isse of Saints,
who diffused the light of Christianity over North Britain, established
the vain opinion, that their Irish countrymen vvere the natural, as
well as spiritual, fathers of the Scottith race. The loose and obscure
tradition has been preserved by the venei-able Bede‚ who scattered
some mys of light over the darkness of the eighth century. On
this ssight foundation, an huge superstructure of fable was gradually
reared, by the bards, and the m0nk33 two orders of men, who
equally abused the privilege of fiction. The Scottissi nation, With
mistaken pride, adopted their Iriffi genealogy: and the anmals of a
long linc of imaginary kings have been adorned by the fancy of
Boethius, ari-d the claffic elegance of Buchanan ¹¹¹.
