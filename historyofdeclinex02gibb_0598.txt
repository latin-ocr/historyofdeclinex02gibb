THE DECLINE AND FAIJL·

of letters, were in the number of 1113 vaffals ; and, by: the strange· -
conneetion of human. events, the ssight* of one of those vagrani.
tribes recalled the viffitorious Parthians from the invasion of Syria ²⁰.
On the fide of the North, the ocean was affigned as the limit of the*-
power of the· Huns. without enemies to reslst their progress, 01·
witnesscs to contradi& their vansty, they might securely atchievev»
a real, or imaginary, conquest of the frozen· regionsof Siberia..
The Norlhern Sea was fixed as the remote boundary of their em-.-
pire. But the name of, that sea, on whose shores the patriot
Sovou embraced the life of a {hepher-d and an exile ³¹, may be
transferred,v with much more probabilitfljo the Baikal, a capa-
cious bason, above three hundred miles in length, which disdains·
the modest appellation of a lake³²‚ and which actually* communi*
cates with the seas of the North, by the long course of the Angara„
the Tongusszzn and the Jeniska. The submiffion of so many dis--
tant nations might flatter the pride of the Tanjou ; but the valour of “
the Huns could be rewarded only by the enjoyment of the wealth .
and luxury of the empire of the South. In the third centur-y before ·
the Christian aera, a wall of fifteen hundred miles‘ in length was
construeted, to defend the frontiers of China against the inroads of “

³¹ The fame of Sovou, or 80-011, hisme-
rit‚ and his singular adventures, are still ce-
lebrated 111 China. See the Eloge de Mouk-
den, p. 20. and notes, p. 241—247.3 and
Men-loires sur lca-Chim, tom. iii. p. 317—-
360.

They all remark the vulgar opinion, that
the [⁷on sea grows angry and tempestuous‚ if
any one presumes to call it a lake. This
grammatical nicety often excites adispute,
between the absurd superstition· of the mari-
ners, and the absurd obstinacy oftravellers. .,

mentioned by Duhalde (tom. ii. p. 45.) and
de Guignes (tom. ii. p. 59.).
