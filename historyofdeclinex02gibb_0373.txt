OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

ed him to encourage, and even to solicit, the reproof of his
friends and ministers; and whenever they ventured to oppose the
irregular sallies of his paffions, the speetators could observe the
shame, as well as the gratitude‚ of their monarch. The decrees of
Julian were almost always founded on the principles of justice3 and
he had the firmness to refist the two most (langerous temptations,

he wished to relieve, were condemned to satisfy the just demands of
a noble and wealthy adversary. He carefully distinguished the judge
from the legissator³⁴j and though he meditated a necessary reform-
ation of the Roman jurisprudence, he pronounced sentence accord-

expectations3 if he had prudcntly declined the paths of greatness,
