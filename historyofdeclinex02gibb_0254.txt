THE DECLINE AND FALL

primates of Africa3 and the death of the latter soon made room for
Domum, who, by his superior abilities and apparent virtues, was
the smnest support of his party. The advantage which Caecilian
might claim from the priority of his ordination, was destroyed by the
illcgal, orat least indecem, haste, with which it had been performed,
without expe<ffing the arrival of the bithops of Numidia. The
authority of these bishops, who, to the number of seventy, con-⁷
demned Caecilian, and consecrated Majorinus, is again weakened by
the infamy of some of their personal characters3 and by the female
intrigues, sacrilegious bargains, and tumultuous proceedings which
are imputed to this Numidian council ⁷. The bishops of the con-
tending fa&iolis maintained, with equal ardour and obstinacy, that
their adversaries were degraded‚ or at ieast dishonoured, by the
odious crime of delivering the Holy Scriptures to the officers of
Diocletian. From their mutual reproaches, as well as from the
story of this dark transaction, it may justly be inferred, that the late
persecution had embittered the zeal, without reforming the manners,
of the African Christians. That divided church was incapable of
affording an impartial judicature3 the controversy was solemnly tried

the Praetorian vicar, and the proconsul of Africa, the report of two
episcopal visitors who had been sent to Carthage, the decr-ees of the
councils of Rome and of Arles, and the supreme judgment of Con- -
