OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE„

of truth and integrity, and Caffian duke of Mesopotamia, a hardy
and veteran soldier, opened a secret negociation with the Satrap
Tamsapor ⁴⁹. These overtures of peace, transsated into the servile
and flattering language of Asta, were transmitted to the camp of the
Great King3 who resolved to fignify, by an ambass'ador, the ternis
which he was inclined to grant to the suppliant Romans. Narses,
whom he invested with that chara&er, was honourably received in
his paffage through Antioch and Constantinople: he reached Sir-
mium after a long journey, and, at his first audience, 1·espe‹ftfully
unfolded the sllken veil which covered the haughty epistle of his
sovereign. Sapor, King of Ki'ngs, and Brother of the Sun and
Moon (such were the lofty titles affected by Oriental vanity), exv
preffed his satisfaffition that his brother, Constantius Caesar, had been
taught wisdom by adversity. As the lawful succeffor of Darius
Hystaspes, Sapor asserted, that the river Strymon in Macedonia was
the true and ancient boundary of his empire3 declaring, however,
that as an evidence of his moderatiori, he would content himself
with the provinces of Armenia and Pvlesopotamia‚ which had been
fraudulently extorted from his ancestors. He alleged, that, without
the restitution of these disputed countries, it was impoffible to esta=
blish any treaty on a solid and permanent basr83 and he arrogantly
threatened, that if his ambafl‘ador returned in vain, he was prepared
to take the field in the spring, and to support the justice of his cause
by the strength of his invincible arms. Narses, who was endowed
with the most polite and amiable manners, endeavoured, as far as
was consistent with his duty, to soften the harssmess of the
meffage ⁵⁰0 Both the style and substance were maturely weighed
