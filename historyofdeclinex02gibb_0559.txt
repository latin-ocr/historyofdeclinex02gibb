they were all of the swarthy race of the Moors; that they inhabited
the back settlements of the Mauritanian and Numidian provinces,
the country, as they ha-ve fince been termed by the Arabs, of dates
and of locusts ¹²⁵ ; and, that, as the Roman power declined in Africa,
the boundary of civilised manners and cultivated land was insenfibly
contrasted. Beyond the utmost limits of the Moors, the vast and

inhospitable desert of the South extends above a thousand mile?= to

the banks of the Niger. The. ancients‚ who had a very faint ancl

imperfect knowledge of the great peninsula of Africa, were sometimes

temp-ted to believe, that the torrid zone must ever remain destitute
of inhabitants ¹²⁶
the vacant space with headless men, or rather monsters ¹

ε and they sometimes amused their fancy by filling

horned and cloven-footed satyrs ¹²³3 with fabulous centaurs ¹² ; and with

human pygmies, who waged a bold and doubtful warfare against the*

cranes ¹³⁰. Carthage would have trembled at the strange intelligence,

rious pielure of the peoplc and the country 3
which are more minutely described in the
Afrique de Mai-mol. torn. iii. p. 1-54.

¹²⁶ This uniuhabitable zone was gradually
reduced, by 'the improvements of ancient
geography, from forty-five‚ to twenty-four,
or even sixteen, degrees of latitude. See a
learned and judicious note ofDr. Roberrson,
Hist. ofAmerica, v-ol. i. p. 426.

Frcret (Memoires de l'Acad. tom. vii. p.

¹³⁰ The fable of the pygmics is as old as
Homer (Iliad iii. 6.). The pygmies of ln-
dia and<AEthiopia were (trispithami) twenty-
seven inches high. Every spring their ca-
