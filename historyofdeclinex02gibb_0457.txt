clamour of a general affault. The Perfians, who, from their walls, «ae-—v--J

contemptuoussy beheld the progress of an impotent attach, celebrated,
with songs of triumph, the glory of Sapor3 and ventured to affure
the emperor, that he might ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd,
before he could hope to take the itnpregnable city of Maogamalcha.
The city was already taken. History has recorded the name of a
private soldier, thre first who ascended from the mine into a deserted
tower. The passage was widened by his companions, who pressed
forwards with impatient valour. Fisteen hundred enemies were al-
ready in the midst of the city. The astonished garrison abandoned
the walls, and their only hope of safety3 the gates were instantly

of the soldiers, and the palaces of Sapor were reduced· to ashes, by
the command of the Roman emperor. Julian, on this occasion,
shewed himself ignorant, or careless, of the laws of civility, which
