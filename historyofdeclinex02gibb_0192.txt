the Germans, after the battle of Stralburgh, encouraged him to thc
first attempt3 and the relufiance of the troops soon yielded to the
persuasive eloquence of a leader, who {har-ed the fatigues and dangers
which he imposed on the meanest of the soldiers. The villages on
either fide of the Meyn, which were plentifully stored with corn
and cattle, felt the ravages of an invading army. The principal
lmuses, constructed with some imitation of Roman elegance, were
consumed by the flame53 and the Caesar boldly advanced about ten
miles, till his progress was stopped by a dark and impenetrable forest,
undermined by subterraneous pallages, which threatened, with secret
snares and ambusti, every step of the affailant. The ground was
already covered with snow3 and Julian, after repairing an ancient
castle which had been emited by Trajan, granted a truce of ten
months to the submiffive Barbarians. At the expiration of the truce&
Julian undertook a second expedition beyond the Rhine‚ to humble
the pride of Surmar and Hormine, two of the kings of the Ale-
manni, who had been present at the battle of Strasburgh. They
promised to restore all the Roman captives who yet remained alive ς

villages of Gaul, of the inhabitants whom they had lost, he detected
every attempt to deceive him with a degree of readiness and accu-
racy‚ which almost establissied the belief of his supernatur-al know-

than the two former. The Germans had collected their military
powers, and moved along the opposite banks of the river, with a
defign of destroying the bridge, and of preventing the pafl'age of
the Romans. But this judicious plan of defence was disconcerted by
