OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The tender Ovid‚ after a youth spent in the enjoyment of fame
and luxury, was condemned to an hopeless exile on the frozen
banks of the Danube, where he was exposed, almost without de-
fence, to the fury of these monsters of the desert, with whose stern
spirits he feared that his gentle {hade might hereafter be confounded.
In his pathetic, but sometimes unmanly lamentations ⁴⁰, he describes
in the most lively colours, the dress and manners, the arms and
inroads of the Getae and Sarmatians, who were affoeiated for the
purposes of destruCtion3 and from the accounts of history, there iza
some reason to believe that these Sarmatians were the Jazygae‚ one of
the most numerous and warlike tribes of the nation. The allure-
ments of plenty engaged them to seek a permanent establilhment on
the frontiers of the empire. Soon after the reign of Augustus, they
obliged the Dacians, who subfisted by fissiing on the banks of the
river Teyss or Tibiscus, to retire into the hilly country, and to aban-
don to the victorious Sarmatians the fertile plains of the Upper

Hungary, which are bounded by the course of the Danube and the

semi-circular inclosure of the Carpathian mountains . In this

advantageous position, they watched or suspended the moment of
attack, as they were provoked by injuries or appeased by presents;
they gradually acquired the skill of using more dangerous wea-
pons3 and although the Sarmatians did not illustrate their name by
any memorable exploits‚ they occafionally aflisted their eastern and

⁴0 The nine books of Poetical Epistles,
which Ovid compos-ed during the seven first
years of his melancholy exile, poffess, be-
fides the merit of elegauce, a double value.
They exhibit a pi8ture of the human mind
under very singular ci1·cumstances; and they
contain many curious observations, which
no Roman, except Ovid, could have an op-
portunity of making. Every circumstance
xxhich tends to illustrate the history of the
barbatiane, haa been drawn together by the

very accurate Count de Buat. Hist. Ancienne
des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. iv. c. xxi.
p. 286—317.
