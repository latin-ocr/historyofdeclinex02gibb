Roman empire from the calamities of civil war. The approach of

winter could not detain the monarch at Antioch 3 and his favourites

durst not oppose his impatient defu-e of revenge. A ssight sever,

which was perhaps occasioned by the agitation of his spirits, was
encreased by the satigues of the journey; and Constantius was
obliged to halt at the little town of NIopsucoene, twelve miles be-
yond Tarsus, where he expired, after a short illness, in the forty-
fifth year of his age, and the twenty—fourth of his reign ⁴². His
genuine character, which was composed of pride and weakness, of
superstition and cruelty, has been fully displayed in the preceding
narrative of civil and ecclefiastical events. The long abuse of power
rendered him a considerable object in the eyes of his contemporaries3

and we are authorised to despisc and detest
the fooliih calumny of Gregory (Orat. iii. p.

death of his benefaftor. The private re-
pentance of the emperor, that he had spared
and promoted Julian (p. 69. and Orat. xxi.
p. 389.), is not improbable in itself, nor·
