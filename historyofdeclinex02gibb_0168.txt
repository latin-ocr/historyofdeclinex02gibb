Barbarians beyond the Danube, he distinguished with specious com-
paffion the Sarmatian exiles, who had been expelled from their native
country by the rebellion of their ssaves, and who formed a very con-
fidei-able acceffion to the power of the Qadi. The emperor, em·-
bracing a genereus but artful system of policy, released the Sarma-
tians from the hands of this huuiiliating dependence, and restored ⁷
them, by a separate treaty‚ to the dignity of a nation united underv
the government of a king, the friend and al'ly of the republic. He
declar-ed his resolution of afferting the justice of their cause, and· of
securing the peace of the provinces by the extirpation, or at least the
banilhment‚ of the Limigantes, whose manners were still infected
with the vices of their servile origin. The execution of this defign
was attended with more difficulty than glory. The territory of the
Limigantes was protected against the Romans by the Danube, against
the hostile Barbarians by the Teyss‚‹ The marshy lands which lay
between those rivers, and were often covered by their immanens,
formed an intricate wilderness, pervious only to the inhabitants, who
were acquainted with its secret paths and inacceflible fortreffes. On
the approach of Constantius, the Limigantes tried the efficacy of
prayers, of fraud, and of arms ; 'but he sternly rejected their sup-
plications, defeated their rude stratagems‚ and repelled with skill and
firmness the efforts of their irregular valour. One of their most
warlike tribes‚. estahlilhed in a small issand towards the conflux of
the Teyss and the Danube, consented to* pass the river* With the in-
tention of surprissng the emperor during the security of an amicable
conferenee. They soon became the vietims of the perfidy which
they meditated. Encompaffed on every fide, trampled down by the
cavalry, ssaughtered by the swords of the legions, they disdained to
ask for mercy ς and with an undaunted countenance still grasped their
