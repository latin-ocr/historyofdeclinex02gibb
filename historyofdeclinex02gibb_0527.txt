step, it was extremely diffieult for him to preserve either the virtue, C {aff-¹⁵·
or the reputation‚ of impartiality. He never aspired, like Con· ι-----ν---θ
stantius, to the farne of a profound theologiam but, as he had re·-
ceived with fimplicity and respe& the tenets of Eudoxus, Valens
resigned his conscience to the direction of his ecclesiastical guides,
and promoted, by the in-fluence of his authority, the re-union of
the Athancfitzn heretics to the body of the catholic church. At first,
he pitied their blindness ; by degrees he was provoked at their obsti-
nacy3 and he insensibly hated those secCtaries to whom he was an
obje& of hatred ⁶⁷. The feeble mind of Valens was always swayed
by the persons with whom he familiai-ly conversed3 and the exile
or imprisonment of a private citizen are the favours the most readily
granted in a despotic court. Such punissiments were frequently in-
flieted on the leaders of the Homooufian party3 and the missortune
of fourscore ecclefiastics of Constantinople, who, perhaps accidentally,
were burnt on {bip-board, was imputed to the cruel and premeditated
malice of the emperor, and his Arian ministers. In every contest, the
catholics (if we may anticipate that name) were obliged to pay the
penalty of their own faults, and of those of their adversaries. In
eveiy eleffion, the claims of the Arian candidate obtained the pre-
ference3 and if they were opposed by the majority of the people,
he was usually supported by the authority of the civil magistrate, ror
even by the terrors of a military force. The enemies of Athanasius
attempted to disturb the last years of his venerable age; and his
temporary retreat to his father's sepulchre has been celebrated as
a fifth exile. But the zeal of a great people‚ who instantly flew
to arms, intimidated the praefe& ; and the archbilhop was permitted
to end his life in peace andin glory, after a reign of forty-seven
