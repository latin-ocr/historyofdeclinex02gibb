THE DECLINE AND FALL

he occasionally exercised, though they were secretly pr0mpted by a

x--v--a Christian zeal, were coloured by the fairest pretences of justice, and

the public good ; and while Constantine dcfigned to ruin the foun-
dations, he seemed to reform the abuses, of the ancient religion.
After the example of the wisest of his prcdeceffors, he condemned,
under the most rigorous penalties, the occult and impious arts of
divinati0n3 which excited the vain hopes, and sometimes the cri- Δ
minal attempts, of those who were discontented with their present
condition. An ignominious filence was imposed on the oracles,
which had been publicly convieted of fraud and falsehood 3 the effe-

minate priests of the Nile were abolished 3 and Constantine dis· ¹

charged the duties of a Roman censor⁷ when he gave orders for the-
demolition of several temples of Phoenicia3 in which every mode
of prostitution was devoutly praeised in the face of day, and to the
honour of Venus ¹⁶¹. The Imperial city of Constantinople was, in

some measure, raised at the expence, and was adorned with the

spoils, of the opulent temples of Greece and Afia3 the sacred pro-
perty was confiscated3 the statues of gods and heroes were trans-
ported‚ with rude familiarity, among a people who considered them
as objects, not of adoration, but of curiosity: the gold and filver
were restored to circulation3 and the magistrates, the bishops, and
the eunuchs, improved the fortunate occaslon of gratifying, at once,
their zeai, their avarice, and their resentment. But these depreda-
tions were confined to a small part of the Roman world3 and the
provinces had been long fince accustomed to endure the same sa-
crilegious rapine, from the tyranny of princes and proconsuls, who
could not be suspected of any defign to subvert the establissied reli-
gion ¹⁶².
