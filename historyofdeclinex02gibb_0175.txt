OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Sapor, that the guilty city of Amida should serve as a funeral pile to
expiate the death, and to perpetuate the memory, of his son.

The antient city of Amid or Amida& which sometimes assumes
the provincial appellation of Dia1·bekir⁵⁶, is advantageoussy situate in
a fertile plain, water-ed by the natural and artificial channcls of the
Tigris, of which the least inconfiderable stream bends in a semicir-
cular form round the eastern part of the city. The emperor Con-
stantius had recently conferred on Amida the honour of his own
name, and the additional fortificationis of strong walls and lofty
towers. It was provided with an arsenal of military engines, and the
ordinary garrison had been reinforced to the amount of seven le-

the Albaniam, the east to the Chionites, inflamed with grief and in-

To the several natione which followed his standard their

covered their front with a formidable line ofIndian elephants⁵³.

⁵⁶ Diarbekir, which is stiled Anum, or Ka-
ra-Arnid, in the public writings ofthe Turks,
contains above 16‚ooo houses, and is the re-
sidence of a pasha with three tails. The epi-
thet of Kara is derived from the blm-huss} of
the stone which compose= the strong and :m-
cient wall of Amida.

⁵⁷ Theoperations ofthe fiege of Amida are
very minutely described by Ammianus (xix.

1—9.)‚ who aeted an honourable part in the

defence, and escaped with difficulty when the
city was stormed by the Perfians¹

⁵³ Of these four nadons, the Albaniana
are too well known to require any description.
The Segestans inhabited a large and level
country, which still preserves their name, to
the south of Khorasan, and the west oinn-
dostan (See Geographia Nubienfis, p. ¹33:
and d‘Herbelot‚ BibliOtheque Orientale, p.
797.). Notwithstanding the boasted viftory
of Bahram (vol. i. p. 4¹0⁴), the Segestam,
above foui-scere years afterwards, appear as
an independent nation, the ally of Persia.
We are ignorantes the situation of the Vert:c
and Chionites, but I am inclined to placc-
them (at least the latter) towards the confines
of India and Scythia. See Ammian. xvi. 9.
