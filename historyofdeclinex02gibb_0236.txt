THE DECL1=NE AND FALL

of the clergy and people, on various occasions, afforded different
precedents, which were insensibly conver-ted into positive laws, and
provincial customs ⁹¹: but it was every where admitted, as a fun-
damental maxim of religious policy, that no bilhop could be
imposed on an orthodox church, without the consent of its inem-
bers. The emperors, as the guardians of the public peace, ancias
the first citizens of Rome and Constantinople, might effeetually de-
clare their wilhes in the choice of a primate: but those absolute
monarchs respected the freedom of ecclefiastical elefflons3 and while
they distributed and resumed the honours of the state and army, they
allowed eighteen hundred perpetual magistrates to receive their im-
portant offices from the free suffrages of the people ⁹². It was
agreeable to the dietates of justice, that these magistrates should not
desert an honourable station from which they could not be re-
moved3 but the wisdom of councils endeavoured, without much
success, to enforce the resldence‚ and to prevent the transsation
of bissiops. The discipline of the West was indeed less relaxed
than that of the East; but the same paffions which made those regu-
lations necessary, rendered thern ineffthual. The reproaches which
angry prelates have so vehemently urged against each other, serve
only to expose their common gunt, and their mutual indiscre-
tion.
