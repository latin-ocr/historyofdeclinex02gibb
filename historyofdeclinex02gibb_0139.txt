OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 119

During the greater part of the summer, the tyrant of Gaul ssiewed C szffitl'·
himself master of the field. The troops of Constantius were haraffed μην-4
and dispirited; his reputation declined in the eye of the world; and
his pride condescended to solicit a treaty of peace, which would
have resigned to the affaffin of Constans the sovereigiity of the pro-
vinces beyond the Alps. These offers were enforced by the eloquence
of Philip, the Imperial ainbaffador; and the council as well as the
army of Magnentius were disposed to accept them. But the haughty
usurper, careless of the remonstrances of his friends, gave orders
that Philip should be detained as a captive, or at least as a hostage3
while he dispatched an officer to reproach Constantius with the weak·
ness of his reign, and to insult him by the promise of a pardon, if
he would instantly abdicate tl‘ie purple. “ Tliat he should confide iii
“ the justice of his cause, and the pi⁴ote6tion of an avenging Deity,”
was the only answer which honour permitted‘ the emperor to return.
But he was so sensible of the difficulties of his situation, that he
no longer dared to retaliate the indignity which had been offered to
his representative. The negociation of Philip was not, however,
ineffeciuah since he determined Sylvanus the Frank, a general of
merit and reputatioii, to desen with a considerable body of cavalry,
a few days before the battle of Nluisa.
