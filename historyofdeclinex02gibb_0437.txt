those festivals were the only days in which the Syrians of Antioch
could reject the allurements of pleasure. The majority of the people

supported the gloryof the Christian name, which had been first in-

vented by their ancestors ¹³: they contented themselves with disobeying

the moral precepts‚ but they were scrupuloussy attached to the specu-

lative do&rines‚of their religion. The church of Antioch was disti-acted

by heresy and schis1n; but the Arians and the Athanafians‚ the fol-

lowers of Meletius and those of Paulinus ¹⁴, were actuated by the

same pious hatred of their common adversary.

The strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of Ξξξέῐῗῶἳὲἓ·

laterai examples, I conclude, that under the
successors of Constantine, the moderate price

price of the fixty-four first years osthe present
