the indefatigable devotion of Julian. On solemn festivals, he regu· k--w-ud

larly visited the temple of the god or goddess to whom the day was
peculiarly consecrated, and endeavoured to excite the religion of 'th'e
magistrates and people by the example of his own zeal. Instead of
maintaining the lofty state of a monarch, distinguished by the splen-
dor of his purple, and encompaffed by the golden {hields of his
guards, Julian solicited, with respedfful eagerness, the meanest offices
which contributed to the worship of the gods. Amidst the sacred
but licentious crowd of priests, of inferior ministers, and of female
dancers, who were* dedicated to the service of the temple, it was the
business of the emperor to bring the wood, to blow the fire, to handle
- the knife, to ssaughter the vicum, and thrusting hie bloody hands
into the‘bowels of the expiring animal, to draw forth the heart or
liver, and to read, with the consummate skill of an haruspex, the
imaginary signs of future events. The wisest of the pagane censur-
ed this extravagant superstition, which affected to despise the re-
straints' of prudence and decency. Under the reign of a prince,
who praetised the rigid maxims of oeconomy, the expence of reli-
gions worship consumed a very large portion of the revenue5 a con-

stant supply of the scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported ’

from distant climates, to bleed on the altars of the gods; an hundred
oxen were frequently sacrificed by Julian on one andthe same day;

and it soon became a popular jest, that if he should return with¹

conquest from the Persian war, the breed of horned cattle must infal-

libly be extinguished. Yet this expence may appear inconfiderable,

when it is compared wirh the splendid presente» which were offered,
either by the hand, or by order, of the emperor, to all the celebrated
places of devotion in the Roman world3 and with the sums allotted
’.ω repair and decorate the ancient temples, which had sufferedtlic
fil-ent decay os time, or the recent injuries of Christian rapine.
