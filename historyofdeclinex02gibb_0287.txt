of AEtius. The guilt of that atheist was aggravated by the suspicions ι--νῄι

*favour of the unfortunate Gallus3 and even the deaths of the Impe-
rial ministers, who had been mafl'aered at Antioch‚ were imputed to
the suggestions of that dangerous sophist. The mind of Constan-
tius, which could neither be moderated by reason, nor fixed by saith,
was blindly impelled to either fide of the dark and empty abyss, by
his horror of the opposite extreme: he alternately embraced and
condemned the sentimenta, he successively banilhed and recalled the
leaders, of the Arian and Semi-Arian fastions ⁹4. During the season
of public busmess or festivity, he employed whole days, and even
nights, in selecting the words, and weighing the syllables, which
composed his fluctuating creeds. The subje& of his meditations still
pursued and occupied his ssumbers3 the incoherent dreams of the
emperor were received as celestial vifions3 and he accepted with com-
placency the lofty title of bishop of bilhops, from those ecclefiastics
who forgot the interest of their order for the gratification of their
paffions. The defign of establilhing an uniformity of dodirine, which
had engaged him to convene so many synods in Gaul‚1taly‚Illyricum,

and Afia, was repeatedly baffled by his own levity, by the divifions
of the Arians, and by the resistance of the catholics ς and he resolved

as t'he last and decifive effort‚ imperioussy to dictate the decrees of ,ai

general couneil. The destruClive earthquake of Nicomedia, the dif-
ficulty of finding a convenient place, and perhaps some secret mo-
·‚tives of policy, produced an alteration in the summons. The bishops
of the East were directed to meet at Seleucia, in Isauria3 while those
of the West held their deliberations at Rinfini, on the coast of the
