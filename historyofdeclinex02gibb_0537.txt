OF* THE ROMAN EMPIRF„

gzrlrxiphum and that experienced general, who had represented, per-
haps with too much prudence, the extreme difficulties οἴ the under-
taking, had the mortification‚ before the end ef the campaign, of
seeing his rival Jovinus convert those difficulties into a (leeil‘we ad-
vantage over the scattered forces of-the Barbariana Aa the head cfa
well-disciplined army of cavalry, infantry, and light troops, Jovinus
advanced, with cautious and rapid steps, to Scarponna ⁵², in the
territory of MetZ, where he surpriscd a large divifion cf the Al„-
manni, before they had time to run to their ,ῆι-[τῖες and flushed his
soldiers with the confidcnce of an easy and bloodless viftory. An-

other divifion, or ratherarrny, of the enemy, after the cruel and'

wanton devastation of the adjacent country, reposed themselves on
the shady banks of the Moselle. Jovintxs, who had viewed the

ground with the eye os a general, made his filcnt approach through
a deep and woody vale, till he could distinffly perccive the indolent
security of the Germans. Some were bathing their huge limhs ⁴10

most confidemble, camp, in the Catalaunian plains, near Chala-az in
Champagne z the struggling (letachments were hastily recallcd ro their
standard, and tlte Barbarian elriefs„alar1ned and admonishcd by the
fate of their compnnions, prepared to encounter, in a decifive battle,
the vickorious forces of the lieutenant of Valentinian. The bloody

and obstinate conffi& lasted a whole summer’s day, withequal va-
