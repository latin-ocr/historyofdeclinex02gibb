OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE ν 53

from the profesfion of the law, on account of the variety of abstrae'ffi C ἐξ Vi} Ρ·
of rcports and references which frequently occurred in the exercise ινφ.)
of their several funilions. From a condescenfion‚ which in former
ages would have been esteemed unworthy of the Roman majesty, a

particular secretary was allowed for the Greek language; and in-
terpreters were appointed to receive th'e ambassadors of the Barba-
rians: but the department of foreign affairs, which constitutes so
effential a part of modern policy, seldorn diverted the attention of
the master of the offices. His mind was more serioussy engaged
by the general dii‘eetion of the posts and arsenals of the empire0
There were thirty-four--cities, fifteen in the east, and nirieteen in the
west, in Which regular companies of Workmen were perpetually
employed in fabricating defenfive armour, offenfive weapons of all
forts, and military engines, which were depolited in the arsenals‚ and
occafionally delivered for the service of the troops. 3. In the course The quaestor,
of nine centuries‚ the office of quaestor had experienced a very fin-
gular revolution. In the infancy of Rome, two inferior magistrates
were annually elefited by the people, to relieve the consuls from the
invidious management of the public treasure ΜΔ5; a fimilaraffistant was
granted to every proconsul, and to every praetor, who exercised a mili-
tary or provincial command; with the extent of conquest, the two
quaestors were gradually multiplied to the number of four, of eight, of
twenty, and, for a short time, perhaps, of forty ¹4⁶3 and the noblest
citizens ambitioully solicited an office which gave them a seat in the

senate, and a just hope of obtaining the honours of the republic.

¹⁴⁵ Tacitus (Annalt xi. 22.) says, that the ¹⁴³ Tacitus (Annal. xi. 22.) seems to con-
first qurestors were elce'ted by the people, {ixty- fider twenty as the highest number of qure-
four years after the foundation of the repub· st0r5; and Dion (Lxliii. p. 374.) iuzinuates,

before that period, been annually appointed it was only to facilitate the paymcnt of an
by the consuls, and even by the kings. But immense debt of gratitude. Yet tlte aug-
this obscure point of antiquity is contested by mentation which he made of praetors subfisted
