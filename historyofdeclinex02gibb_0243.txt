OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 23

the Nicene council was edified by his public declaration, that if he C {¹}sp P.
surprised a bishop in the a& of adustery, he should cast his Imperial k—-w-—J
mantle over the episcopal smner. 2. The domestic jurisdi&ion of
the bishops was at once a privilege and a restraint of the eeclesias-
tical order, whose civil causes were decently withdrawn from the
cognizance of a secular judge. Their venial offences were not
exposed to the {haine of a public trial or punissnnent 3 and the gentle
correffion, which the tenderness of youth may endure from its pa-

and beneficiat profession, the Roman magistrate drew the sword
of justice, without any regard to ecclefiastical immunities. 3. The
arbitration of the bissmps was ratified by a positive law; and the
judges were insti-utited to execute, without appeal or delay, the
episcopal decrees, whose validity had hitherto depended on the con—⁷

and of the whole empire, might gradually remove the fears and
:scruples of the Christians, But they still resorted to the tribunal of
the biihops, whose abilities and integrity they esteemed3 and the
venerable Austin enjoyed the satisfaffion of complaining that his
spiritual fundtions were perpetually interrupted by the invidious la-
bour of deciding the claim or the possession of srlver and gold, of
lands and cattle. 4. The ancient privilege of sanstuary was trans-
ferred to the Christian templeS, and extended, by the liberal>
piety of the younger Theodosius, to the p1·ecin6³[s of consecrated
ground ¹¹³. The fugitive, and'evcn guilty, suppliants‚ were permitted
