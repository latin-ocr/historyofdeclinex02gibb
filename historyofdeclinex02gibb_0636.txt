THE DECLINE AND FALL

sustained in the fields of Cannae ⁹³. Two master-generals of the
cavalry and infantry, tvvo great officere. of the palacc, and thirty-five
tribunes, were found among the ssain3 and the death of Sebastian
might satisfy the world, that he was the victim, as well as the au-
thor, of the public calamity. Above two-thirds of the Roman army
were destroyed: and the darkness of the night was esteemed a very
favourable circumstance3 as it served to conceal the flight of the
multitude, and to protect the more orderly retreat of Victor and
Richomer, who alone, amidst the general consternation, maintained
the advantage of calm courage, and regular discipline ⁹⁴.

While the impreffions of grief and terror were still recent in the
minds of men, the most celebrated rhetorici-an of the age composed
the funeral oration of a vanquished army, and of an unpopular
prince, whose throne was already occupied by a stranger. “ There
“ are not wanting,'’ says the candid Libanius, “ those who arraign
‘⁶ the prudence of the emperor, or who impute the public misfortune

the grave Polybius, no more than 370 horse,
and 3000 foot‚ escaped from the field of Can-
nae: 1o‚000 were made prisonerm and the
number of the ssain amounted to 5630 horse,
and 70,000 foot (Polyb. l. iii. p. 371. edit.
Casmbon, in Rvo). Livy (xxii. 49.) is
somewhat less bloody: he ssaughters only
2700 horse, and 4o‚000 foot. The Roman
